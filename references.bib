	abstract = {The {DNA} sequencing technologies in use today produce either highly accurate short reads or less-accurate long reads. We report the optimization of circular consensus sequencing ({CCS}) to improve the accuracy of single-molecule real-time ({SMRT}) sequencing ({PacBio}) and generate highly accurate (99.8\%) long high-fidelity ({HiFi}) reads with an average length of 13.5 kilobases (kb). We applied our approach to sequence the well-characterized human {HG}002/{NA}24385 genome and obtained precision and recall rates of at least 99.91\% for single-nucleotide variants ({SNVs}), 95.98\% for insertions and deletions {\textless}50 bp (indels) and 95.99\% for structural variants. Our {CCS} method matches or exceeds the ability of short-read sequencing to detect small variants and structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the ‘genome in a bottle’ ({GIAB}) benchmark set. Nearly all (99.64\%) variants can be phased into haplotypes, further improving variant detection. De novo genome assembly using {CCS} reads alone produced a contiguous and accurate genome with a contig N50 of {\textgreater}15 megabases (Mb) and concordance of 99.997\%, substantially outperforming assembly with less-accurate long reads.},

	shorttitle = {Open-access bacterial population genomics},
	abstract = {The {PubMLST}.org website hosts a collection of open-access, curated databases that integrate population sequence data with provenance and phenotype information for over 100 different microbial species and genera.  Although the {PubMLST} website was conceived as part of the development of the first multi-locus sequence typing ({MLST}) scheme in 1998 the software it uses, the Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence database ({BIGSdb}, published in 2010), enables {PubMLST} to include all levels of sequence data, from single gene sequences up to and including complete, finished genomes.  Here we describe developments in the {BIGSdb} software made from publication to June 2018 and show how the platform realises microbial population genomics for a wide range of applications.  The system is based on the gene-by-gene analysis of microbial genomes, with each deposited sequence annotated and curated to identify the genes present and systematically catalogue their variation.  Originally intended as a means of characterising isolates with typing schemes, the synthesis of sequences and records of genetic variation with provenance and phenotype data permits highly scalable (whole genome sequence data for tens of thousands of isolates) means of addressing a wide range of functional questions, including: the prediction of antimicrobial resistance; likely cross-reactivity with vaccine antigens; and the functional activities of different variants that lead to key phenotypes.  There are no limitations to the number of sequences, genetic loci, allelic variants or schemes (combinations of loci) that can be included, enabling each database to represent an expanding catalogue of the genetic variation of the population in question.  In addition to providing web-accessible analyses and links to third-party analysis and visualisation tools, the {BIGSdb} software includes a {RESTful} application programming interface ({API}) that enables access to all the underlying data for third-party applications and data analysis pipelines.},

	abstract = {We have employed whole genome sequencing to define and evaluate a core genome multilocus sequence typing ({cgMLST}) scheme for Acinetobacter baumannii. To define a core genome we downloaded a total of 1,573 putative A. baumannii genomes from {NCBI} as well as representative isolates belonging to the eight previously described international A. baumannii clonal lineages. The core genome was then employed against a total of fifty-three carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates that were previously typed by {PFGE} and linked to hospital outbreaks in eight German cities. We defined a core genome of 2,390 genes of which an average 98.4\% were called successfully from 1,339 A. baumannii genomes, while Acinetobacter nosocomialis, Acinetobacter pittii, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus resulted in 71.2\%, 33.3\%, and 23.2\% good targets, respectively. When tested against the previously identified outbreak strains, we found good correlation between {PFGE} and {cgMLST} clustering, with 0-8 allelic differences within a pulsotype, and 40-2,166 differences between pulsotypes. The highest number of allelic differences was between the isolates representing the international clones. This typing scheme was highly discriminatory and identified separate A. baumannii outbreaks. Moreover, because a standardised {cgMLST} nomenclature is used, the system will allow inter-laboratory exchange of data.},

The vast amount of data generated by these advancements necessitates efficient algorithms to extract meaningful information. K-mers serve as a valuable tool when working with large sequencing datasets, offering several advantages in computational speed and memory efficiency and carrying the potential for intrinsic biological functionality. This review provides an overview of the methods, applications, and significance of k-mers in genomic and proteomic data analyses, as well as the utility of absent sequences, including nullomers and nullpeptides, in disease detection, vaccine development, therapeutics, and forensic science. Therefore, the review highlights the pivotal role of k-mers in addressing current genomic and proteomic problems and underscores their potential for future breakthroughs in research.},

	abstract = {{SUMMARY}: The population biology of Streptococcus pneumoniae is poorly understood. Most of the important issues could be addressed by the molecular characterization of large, well sampled populations from carriage and from the different manifestations of pneumococcal disease. The authors have therefore developed a pneumococcal multilocus sequence typing scheme and database by sequencing - 450 bp fragments of seven housekeeping loci from 295 isolates. The combination of alleles at the seven loci provided an allelic profile, or sequence type ({ST}), and the relatedness between isolates was obtained by constructing a dendrogram from the matrix of paiwvise differences between {STs}. The typing scheme was validated using pneumococci of known genetic relatedness and could resolve 6 billion {STs}. Among 274 isolates from recent cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in eight countries,143 {STs} were resolved, but 12 {STs} contained at least five isolates (range 5-21 isolates). The repeated recovery of indistinguishable isolates from invasive disease in different countries implies that these {STs} define strains with an increased capacity to cause invasive disease. The relationship between {STs} and serotypes suggested that, in the longer term, capsular genes have been distributed horizontally within the pneumococcal population, but in the short term, expansion of clones occurs with only occasional changes of serotype. The multilocus sequence typing scheme provides a powerful new approach to the characterization of pneumococci, since it provides molecular typing datathat are electronically portable between laboratories, and which can be used to probe aspects of the population and evolutionary biology of these organisms. A Web sitefor themolecular characterization of pneumococci by {MLST} is available (http://mlst.zoo.ox.ac.uk).},
