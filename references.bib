	abstract = {Chewie Nomenclature Server (chewie-NS, https://chewbbaca.online/) allows users to share genome-based gene-by-gene typing schemas and to maintain a common nomenclature, simplifying the comparison of results. The combination between local analyses and a public repository of allelic data strikes a balance between potential confidentiality issues and the need to compare results. The possibility of deploying private instances of chewie-NS facilitates the creation of nomenclature servers with a restricted user base to allow compliance with the strictest data policies. Chewie-NS allows users to easily share their own schemas and to explore publicly available schemas, including informative statistics on schemas and loci presented in interactive charts and tables. Users can retrieve all the information necessary to run a schema locally or all the alleles identified at a particular locus. The integration with the chewBBACA suite enables users to directly upload new schemas to chewie-NS, download existing schemas and synchronize local and remote schemas from chewBBACA command line version, allowing an easier integration into high-throughput analysis pipelines. The same REST API linking chewie-NS and the chewBBACA suite supports the interaction of other interfaces or pipelines with the databases available at chewie-NS, facilitating the reusability of the stored data.},

	abstract = {Streptococcus pyogenes is a major human pathogen with high genetic diversity, largely created by recombination and horizontal gene transfer, making it difficult to use single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome-wide analyses for surveillance. Using a gene-by-gene approach on 208 complete genomes of S. pyogenes, a novel whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) schema was developed, comprising 3,044 target loci. The schema was used for core-genome MLST (cgMLST) analyses of previously published data sets and 265 newly sequenced draft genomes with other molecular and phenotypic typing data. Clustering based on cgMLST data supported the genetic heterogeneity of many emm types and correlated poorly with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis macrorestriction profiling, superantigen gene profiling, and MLST sequence type, highlighting the limitations of older typing methods. While 763 loci were present in all isolates of a data set representative of S. pyogenes genetic diversity, the proposed schema allows scalable cgMLST analysis, which can include more loci for an increased resolution when typing closely related isolates. The cgMLST and PopPUNK clusters were broadly consistent in this diverse population. The cgMLST analyses presented results comparable to those of SNP-based methods in the identification of two recently emerged sublineages of emm1 and emm89 and the clarification of the genetic relatedness among isolates recovered in outbreak contexts. The schema was thoroughly annotated and made publicly available on the chewie-NS online platform (https://chewbbaca.online/species/1/schemas/1), providing a framework for high-resolution typing and analyzing the genetic variability of loci of particular biological interest.},

Here, we provide an overview of how EnteroBase works, what it can do, and its future prospects. EnteroBase has currently assembled more than 300,000 genomes from Illumina short reads from Salmonella, Escherichia, Yersinia, Clostridioides, Helicobacter, Vibrio, and Moraxella and genotyped those assemblies by core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). Hierarchical clustering of cgMLST sequence types allows mapping a new bacterial strain to predefined population structures at multiple levels of resolution within a few hours after uploading its short reads. Case Study 1 illustrates this process for local transmissions of Salmonella enterica serovar Agama between neighboring social groups of badgers and humans. EnteroBase also supports single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls from both genomic assemblies and after extraction from metagenomic sequences, as illustrated by Case Study 2 which summarizes the microevolution of Yersinia pestis over the last 5000 years of pandemic plague. EnteroBase can also provide a global overview of the genomic diversity within an entire genus, as illustrated by Case Study 3, which presents a novel, global overview of the population structure of all of the species, subspecies, and clades within Escherichia.},

A dominant method of such string matching is the 'seed-and-extend' approach, in which occurrences of short subsequences called 'seeds' are used to search for potentially longer matches in a large database of sequences. Each such potential match is then checked to see if it extends beyond the seed. To be effective, the seed-and-extend approach needs to catalogue seeds from virtually every substring in the database of search strings. Projects such as mammalian genome assemblies and large-scale protein matching, however, have such large sequence databases that the resulting list of seeds cannot be stored in RAM on a single computer. This significantly slows the matching process.
RESULTS: We present a simple and elegant method in which only a small fraction of seeds, called 'minimizers', needs to be stored. Using minimizers can speed up string-matching computations by a large factor while missing only a small fraction of the matches found using all seeds.},

	abstract = {Arcobacter butzleri is a foodborne emerging human pathogen, frequently displaying a multidrug resistant character. Still, the lack of comprehensive genome-scale comparative analysis has limited our knowledge on A. butzleri diversification and pathogenicity. Here, we performed a deep genome analysis of A. butzleri focused on decoding its core- and pan-genome diversity and specific genetic traits underlying its pathogenic potential and diverse ecology. A. butzleri (genome size 2.07–2.58 Mbp) revealed a large open pan-genome with 7474 genes (about 50\% being singletons) and a small but diverse core-genome with 1165 genes. It presents a plastic virulome (including newly identified determinants), marked by the differential presence of multiple adaptation-related virulence factors, such as the urease cluster ureD(AB)CEFG (phenotypically confirmed), the hypervariable hemagglutinin-encoding hecA, a type I secretion system (T1SS) harboring another agglutinin and a novel VirB/D4 T4SS likely linked to interbacterial competition and cytotoxicity. In addition, A. butzleri harbors a large repertoire of efflux pumps (EPs) and other antibiotic resistant determinants. We unprecedentedly describe a genetic mechanism of A. butzleri macrolides resistance, (inactivation of a TetR repressor likely regulating an EP). Fluoroquinolones resistance correlated with Thr-85-Ile in GyrA and ampicillin resistance was linked to an OXA-15-like β-lactamase. Remarkably, by decoding the polymorphism pattern of the main antigen PorA, we show that A. butzleri is able to exchange porA as a whole and/or hypervariable epitope-encoding regions separately, leading to a multitude of chimeric PorA presentations that can impact pathogen-host interaction during infection. Ultimately, our unprecedented screening of short sequence repeats indicates that phase variation likely modulates A. butzleri key adaptive functions. In summary, this study constitutes a turning point on A. butzleri comparative genomics revealing that this human gastrointestinal pathogen is equipped with vast and diverse virulence and antibiotic resistance arsenals that open a multitude of phenotypic fingerprints for environmental/host adaptation and pathogenicity.},

It is parameterized by the k-mer length k, a window length w and an order on the k-mers. Minimizers are used in a large number of softwares and pipelines to improve computation efficiency and decrease memory usage. Despite the method’s popularity, many theoretical questions regarding its performance remain open. The core metric for measuring performance of a minimizer is the density, which measures the sparsity of sampled k-mers. The theoretical optimal density for a minimizer is 1/w, provably not achievable in general. For given k and w, little is known about asymptotically optimal minimizers, that is minimizers with density O(1/w).We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of asymptotically optimal minimizers. We also provide a randomized algorithm, called the Miniception, to design minimizers with the best theoretical guarantee to date on density in practical scenarios. Constructing and using the Miniception is as easy as constructing and using a random minimizer, which allows the design of efficient minimizers that scale to the values of k and w used in current bioinformatics software programs.Reference implementation of the Miniception and the codes for analysis can be found at https://github.com/kingsford-group/miniception.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

In order to extract relevant information from the large quantity and complex data produced by WGS, a host of bioinformatics tools has been developed, allowing users to analyze and interpret sequencing data, starting from simple gene-searches to complex phylogenetic studies. Depending on the research question, the complexity of the dataset and their bioinformatics skill set, users can choose between a great variety of tools for the analysis of WGS data. In this review, we describe the relevant approaches for phylogenomic studies for outbreak studies and give an overview of selected tools for the characterization of foodborne pathogens based on WGS data.

	abstract = {Defining the population structure of a pathogen is a key part of epidemiology, as genomically related isolates are likely to share key clinical features such as antimicrobial resistance profiles and invasiveness. Multiple different methods are currently used to cluster together closely related genomes, potentially leading to inconsistency between studies. Here, we use a global dataset of 26 306 Streptococcus pneumoniae genomes to compare four clustering methods: gene-by-gene seven-locus MLST, core genome MLST (cgMLST)-based hierarchical clustering (HierCC) assignments, life identification number (LIN) barcoding and k-mer-based PopPUNK clustering (known as GPSCs in this species). We compare the clustering results with phylogenetic and pan-genome analyses to assess their relationship with genome diversity and evolution, as we would expect a good clustering method to form a single monophyletic cluster that has high within-cluster similarity of genomic content. We show that the four methods are generally able to accurately reflect the population structure based on these metrics and that the methods were broadly consistent with each other. We investigated further to study the discrepancies in clusters. The greatest concordance was seen between LIN barcoding and HierCC (adjusted mutual information score=0.950), which was expected given that both methods utilize cgMLST, but have different methods for defining an individual cluster and different core genome schema. However, the existence of differences between the two methods shows that the selection of a core genome schema can introduce inconsistencies between studies. GPSC and HierCC assignments were also highly concordant (AMI=0.946), showing that k-mer-based methods which use the whole genome and do not require the careful selection of a core genome schema are just as effective at representing the population structure. Additionally, where there were differences in clustering between these methods, this could be explained by differences in the accessory genome that were not identified in cgMLST. We conclude that for S. pneumoniae, standardized and stable nomenclature is important as the number of genomes available expands. Furthermore, the research community should transition away from seven-locus MLST, whilst cgMLST, GPSC and LIN assignments should be used more widely. However, to allow for easy comparison between studies and to make previous literature relevant, the reporting of multiple clustering names should be standardized within the research.},

Capabilities of laboratory-based surveillance and epidemic alert systems should be enhanced by fostering (i) universal access to real-time whole genome sequence (WGS) data of pathogens to inform clinical practice, infection control, public health policies, and vaccine and antimicrobial drug research and development; (ii) integration of diagnostic microbiology data, data from testing asymptomatic individuals, pathogen sequence data, clinical data, and epidemiological data into surveillance programs; (iii) stronger cross-sectorial collaborations between healthcare, public health, animal health, and environmental surveillance and research using One Health approaches, toward understanding the ecology and transmission pathways of pathogens and AMR across ecosystems; (iv) international collaboration and interconnection of surveillance networks, harmonization of laboratory methods, and standardization of surveillance methods for global reporting, including on pathogen genomic variant or strain nomenclature; (v) responsible data sharing between surveillance networks, databases, and platforms according to FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles; and (vi) research on genomic surveillance system implementation and its cost-effectiveness for different pathogens and AMR threats across different settings. Regional and global One Health policies and governance initiatives should foster the concerted development and efficient utilization of pathogen genomic surveillance to protect the health of humans, animals, and the environment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this regard, data obtained from WGS analysis can provide information on the unambiguous taxonomic identification of the strains, on the presence of genes of concern (e.g. those encoding virulence factors, resistance to antimicrobials of clinical relevance for humans and animals, production of harmful metabolites or of clinically relevant antimicrobials) and on the characterisation of genetic modification(s) (where relevant). This document provides recommendations to applicants on how to describe and report the results of WGS analyses in the context of an application for market authorisation of a regulated product. Indications are given on how to perform genome sequencing and the quality criteria/thresholds that should be reached, as well as the data and relevant information that need to be reported, if required.

	abstract = {Accurately identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from bacterial sequencing data is an essential requirement for using genomics to track transmission and predict important phenotypes such as antimicrobial resistance. However, most previous performance evaluations of SNP calling have been restricted to eukaryotic (human) data. Additionally, bacterial SNP calling requires choosing an appropriate reference genome to align reads to, which, together with the bioinformatic pipeline, affects the accuracy and completeness of a set of SNP calls obtained. This study evaluates the performance of 209 SNP-calling pipelines using a combination of simulated data from 254 strains of 10 clinically common bacteria and real data from environmentally sourced and genomically diverse isolates within the genera Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, and Klebsiella.We evaluated the performance of 209 SNP-calling pipelines, aligning reads to genomes of the same or a divergent strain. Irrespective of pipeline, a principal determinant of reliable SNP calling was reference genome selection. Across multiple taxa, there was a strong inverse relationship between pipeline sensitivity and precision, and the Mash distance (a proxy for average nucleotide divergence) between reads and reference genome. The effect was especially pronounced for diverse, recombinogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli but less dominant for clonal species such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.The accuracy of SNP calling for a given species is compromised by increasing intra-species diversity. When reads were aligned to the same genome from which they were sequenced, among the highest-performing pipelines was Novoalign/GATK. By contrast, when reads were aligned to particularly divergent genomes, the highest-performing pipelines often used the aligners NextGenMap or SMALT, and/or the variant callers LoFreq, mpileup, or Strelka.},

However, the choice of a reference may represent a source of errors that may affect subsequent analyses such as the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phylogenetic inference. In this work, we evaluated the effect of reference choice on short-read sequence data from five clinically and epidemiologically relevant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens). Publicly available whole-genome assemblies encompassing the genomic diversity of these species were selected as reference sequences, and read alignment statistics, SNP calling, recombination rates, dN/dS ratios, and phylogenetic trees were evaluated depending on the mapping reference. The choice of different reference genomes proved to have an impact on almost all the parameters considered in the five species. In addition, these biases had potential epidemiological implications such as including/excluding isolates of particular clades and the estimation of genetic distances. These findings suggest that the single reference approach might introduce systematic errors during mapping that affect subsequent analyses, particularly for data sets with isolates from genetically diverse backgrounds. In any case, exploring the effects of different references on the final conclusions is highly recommended.},

	abstract = {The minimizers scheme is a method for selecting k-mers from sequences. It is used in many bioinformatics software tools to bin comparable sequences or to sample a sequence in a deterministic fashion at approximately regular intervals, in order to reduce memory consumption and processing time. Although very useful, the minimizers selection procedure has undesirable behaviors (e.g. too many k-mers are selected when processing certain sequences). Some of these problems were already known to the authors of the minimizers technique, and the natural lexicographic ordering of k-mers used by minimizers was recognized as their origin. Many software tools using minimizers employ ad hoc variations of the lexicographic order to alleviate those issues.We provide an in-depth analysis of the effect of k-mer ordering on the performance of the minimizers technique. By using small universal hitting sets (a recently defined concept), we show how to significantly improve the performance of minimizers and avoid some of its worse behaviors. Based on these results, we encourage bioinformatics software developers to use an ordering based on a universal hitting set or, if not possible, a randomized ordering, rather than the lexicographic order. This analysis also settles negatively a conjecture (by Schleimer et al.) on the expected density of minimizers in a random sequence.The software used for this analysis is available on GitHub: https://github.com/gmarcais/minimizers.git.},

	doi = {10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30446-3},
	abstract = {Background
Since 2014, England has seen increased scarlet fever activity unprecedented in modern times. In 2016, England's scarlet fever seasonal rise coincided with an unexpected elevation in invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infections. We describe the molecular epidemiological investigation of these events.
Methods
We analysed changes in S pyogenes emm genotypes, and notifications of scarlet fever and invasive disease in 2014–16 using regional (northwest London) and national (England and Wales) data. Genomes of 135 non-invasive and 552 invasive emm1 isolates from 2009–16 were analysed and compared with 2800 global emm1 sequences. Transcript and protein expression of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA; also known as scarlet fever or erythrogenic toxin A) in sequenced, non-invasive emm1 isolates was quantified by real-time PCR and western blot analyses.
Findings
Coincident with national increases in scarlet fever and invasive disease notifications, emm1 S pyogenes upper respiratory tract isolates increased significantly in northwest London in the March to May period, from five (5\%) of 96 isolates in 2014, to 28 (19\%) of 147 isolates in 2015 (p=0·0021 vs 2014 values), to 47 (33\%) of 144 in 2016 (p=0·0080 vs 2015 values). Similarly, invasive emm1 isolates collected nationally in the same period increased from 183 (31\%) of 587 in 2015 to 267 (42\%) of 637 in 2016 (p{\textless}0·0001). Sequences of emm1 isolates from 2009–16 showed emergence of a new emm1 lineage (designated M1UK)—with overlap of pharyngitis, scarlet fever, and invasive M1UK strains—which could be genotypically distinguished from pandemic emm1 isolates (M1global) by 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Median SpeA protein concentration in supernatant was nine-times higher among M1UK isolates (190·2 ng/mL [IQR 168·9–200·4]; n=10) than M1global isolates (20·9 ng/mL [0·0–27·3]; n=10; p{\textless}0·0001). M1UK expanded nationally to represent 252 (84\%) of all 299 emm1 genomes in 2016. Phylogenetic analysis of published datasets identified single M1UK isolates in Denmark and the USA.
Interpretation
A dominant new emm1 S pyogenes lineage characterised by increased SpeA production has emerged during increased S pyogenes activity in England. The expanded reservoir of M1UK and recognised invasive potential of emm1 S pyogenes provide plausible explanation for the increased incidence of invasive disease, and rationale for global surveillance.

Methodology/Principal Findings Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the “CAT” approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100–1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory. Conclusions/Significance FastTree 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments. FastTree 2 is freely available at http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

As the volume and complexity of biological sequence data grow, public repositories face significant challenges in ensuring that the data is easily discoverable and usable by the biological research community. To address these challenges, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has created NCBI Datasets. This resource provides straightforward, comprehensive, and scalable access to biological sequences, annotations, and metadata for a wide range of taxa. Following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data management principles, NCBI Datasets offers user-friendly web interfaces, command-line tools, and documented APIs, empowering researchers to access NCBI data seamlessly. The data is delivered as packages of sequences and metadata, thus facilitating improved data retrieval, sharing, and usability in research. Moreover, this data delivery method fosters effective data attribution and promotes its further reuse. This paper outlines the current scope of data accessible through NCBI Datasets and explains various options for exploring and downloading the data.},

	abstract = {The open sharing of genomic data provides an incredibly rich resource for the study of bacterial evolution and function and even anthropogenic activities such as the widespread use of antimicrobials. However, these data consist of genomes assembled with different tools and levels of quality checking, and of large volumes of completely unprocessed raw sequence data. In both cases, considerable computational effort is required before biological questions can be addressed. Here, we assembled and characterised 661,405 bacterial genomes retrieved from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) in November of 2018 using a uniform standardised approach. Of these, 311,006 did not previously have an assembly. We produced a searchable COmpact Bit-sliced Signature (COBS) index, facilitating the easy interrogation of the entire dataset for a specific sequence (e.g., gene, mutation, or plasmid). Additional MinHash and pp-sketch indices support genome-wide comparisons and estimations of genomic distance. Combined, this resource will allow data to be easily subset and searched, phylogenetic relationships between genomes to be quickly elucidated, and hypotheses rapidly generated and tested. We believe that this combination of uniform processing and variety of search/filter functionalities will make this a resource of very wide utility. In terms of diversity within the data, a breakdown of the 639,981 high-quality genomes emphasised the uneven species composition of the ENA/public databases, with just 20 of the total 2,336 species making up 90\% of the genomes. The overrepresented species tend to be acute/common human pathogens, aligning with research priorities at different levels from individual interests to funding bodies and national and global public health agencies.},

Several ongoing pangenome projects are producing collections of high-quality assemblies of various species.

Our tool compresses the genomes significantly better than the existing programs and is much faster. Moreover, its unique feature is the ability to access any contig (or its part) in a fraction of a second and easily append new samples to the compressed collections. Thanks to this, AGC could be useful not only for backup or transfer purposes but also for routine analysis of pangenome sequences in common pipelines. With the rapidly reduced cost and improved accuracy of sequencing technologies, we anticipate more comprehensive pangenome projects with much larger sample sizes. AGC is likely to become a foundation tool to store, distribute and access pangenome data.The source code of AGC is available at https://github.com/refresh-bio/agc.

Genomic, DNA-DNA microarray, and single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses indicated that this clone evolved through a series of horizontal gene transfer events that involved (1) the acquisition of prophages encoding streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A and extracellular DNases and (2) the reciprocal recombination of a 36-kb chromosomal region encoding the extracellular toxins NAD+-glycohydrolase (NADase) and streptolysin O (SLO). These gene transfer events were associated with significantly increased production of SLO and NADase. Virtual identity in the 36-kb region present in contemporary serotype M1 and M12 isolates suggests that a serotype M12 strain served as the donor of this region. Multiple horizontal gene transfer events were a crucial factor in the evolutionary origin and emergence of a very abundant contemporary clone of serotype M1 GAS},

Sketching approaches entice with improved scalability but also carry the danger of decreased accuracy and added bias. In this article, we investigate the minimizer sketch and its use to estimate the Jaccard similarity between two sequences.We show that the minimizer Jaccard estimator is biased and inconsistent, which means that the expected difference (i.e. the bias) between the estimator and the true value is not zero, even in the limit as the lengths of the sequences grow. We derive an analytical formula for the bias as a function of how the shared k-mers are laid out along the sequences. We show both theoretically and empirically that there are families of sequences where the bias can be substantial (e.g. the true Jaccard can be more than double the estimate). Finally, we demonstrate that this bias affects the accuracy of the widely used mashmap read mapping tool.Scripts to reproduce our experiments are available at https://github.com/medvedevgroup/minimizer-jaccard-estimator/tree/main/reproduce.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

However, recent experimental research suggesting a more diverse view motivated us to develop an algorithm with improved gene-finding accuracy. We describe GeneMarkS-2, an ab initio algorithm that uses a model derived by self-training for finding species-specific (native) genes, along with an array of precomputed "heuristic" models designed to identify harder-to-detect genes (likely horizontally transferred). Importantly, we designed GeneMarkS-2 to identify several types of distinct sequence patterns (signals) involved in gene expression control, among them the patterns characteristic for leaderless transcription as well as noncanonical RBS patterns. To assess the accuracy of GeneMarkS-2, we used genes validated by COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) annotation, proteomics experiments, and N-terminal protein sequencing. We observed that GeneMarkS-2 performed better on average in all accuracy measures when compared with the current state-of-the-art gene prediction tools. Furthermore, the screening of ∼5000 representative prokaryotic genomes made by GeneMarkS-2 predicted frequent leaderless transcription in both archaea and bacteria. We also observed that the RBS sites in some species with leadered transcription did not necessarily exhibit the Shine-Dalgarno consensus. The modeling of different types of sequence motifs regulating gene expression prompted a division of prokaryotic genomes into five categories with distinct sequence patterns around the gene starts.},

	abstract = {Traditional and molecular typing schemes for the characterization of pathogenic microorganisms are poorly portable because they index variation that is difficult to compare among laboratories. To overcome these problems, we propose multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which exploits the unambiguous nature and electronic portability of nucleotide sequence data for the characterization of microorganisms. To evaluate MLST, we determined the sequences of ≈470-bp fragments from 11 housekeeping genes in a reference set of 107 isolates of Neisseria meningitidis from invasive disease and healthy carriers. For each locus, alleles were assigned arbitrary numbers and dendrograms were constructed from the pairwise differences in multilocus allelic profiles by cluster analysis. The strain associations obtained were consistent with clonal groupings previously determined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. A subset of six gene fragments was chosen that retained the resolution and congruence achieved by using all 11 loci. Most isolates from hyper-virulent lineages of serogroups A, B, and C meningococci were identical for all loci or differed from the majority type at only a single locus. MLST using six loci therefore reliably identified the major meningococcal lineages associated with invasive disease. MLST can be applied to almost all bacterial species and other haploid organisms, including those that are difficult to cultivate. The overwhelming advantage of MLST over other molecular typing methods is that sequence data are truly portable between laboratories, permitting one expanding global database per species to be placed on a World-Wide Web site, thus enabling exchange of molecular typing data for global epidemiology via the Internet.},

	abstract = {A range of methodologies may be used for analyzing bacteria, depending on the purpose and the level of resolution needed. The capability for recognition of species distinctions within the complex spectrum of bacterial diversity is necessary for progress in microbiological research. In clinical settings, accurate, rapid and cost-effective methods are essential for early and efficient treatment of infections. Characterization and identification of microorganisms, using, bottom-up proteomics, or “proteotyping”, relies on recognition of species-unique or associated peptides, by tandem mass spectrometry analyses, dependent upon an accurate and comprehensive foundation of genome sequence data, allowing for differentiation of species, at amino acid-level resolution. In this study, the high resolution and accuracy of MS/MS-based proteotyping was demonstrated, through analyses of the three phylogenetically and taxonomically most closely-related species of the Mitis Group of the genus Streptococcus: i.e., the pathogenic species, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), and the commensal species, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and Streptococcus mitis. To achieve high accuracy, a genome sequence database used for matching peptides was created and carefully curated. Here, MS-based, bottom-up proteotyping was observed and confirmed to attain the level of resolution necessary for differentiating and identifying the most-closely related bacterial species, as demonstrated by analyses of species of the Streptococcus Mitis Group, even when S. pneumoniae were mixed with S. pseudopneumoniae and S. mitis, by matching and identifying more than 200 unique peptides for each species.},

	abstract = {This Opinion considers the application of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and metagenomics for outbreak investigation, source attribution and risk assessment of food-borne pathogens. WGS offers the highest level of bacterial strain discrimination for food-borne outbreak investigation and source-attribution as well as potential for more precise hazard identification, thereby facilitating more targeted risk assessment and risk management. WGS improves linking of sporadic cases associated with different food products and geographical regions to a point source outbreak and can facilitate epidemiological investigations, allowing also the use of previously sequenced genomes. Source attribution may be favoured by improved identification of transmission pathways, through the integration of spatial-temporal factors and the detection of multidirectional transmission and pathogen–host interactions. Metagenomics has potential, especially in relation to the detection and characterisation of non-culturable, difficult-to-culture or slow-growing microorganisms, for tracking of hazard-related genetic determinants and the dynamic evaluation of the composition and functionality of complex microbial communities. A SWOT analysis is provided on the use of WGS and metagenomics for Salmonella and Shigatoxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) serotyping and the identification of antimicrobial resistance determinants in bacteria. Close agreement between phenotypic and WGS-based genotyping data has been observed. WGS provides additional information on the nature and localisation of antimicrobial resistance determinants and on their dissemination potential by horizontal gene transfer, as well as on genes relating to virulence and biological fitness. Interoperable data will play a major role in the future use of WGS and metagenomic data. Capacity building based on harmonised, quality controlled operational systems within European laboratories and worldwide is essential for the investigation of cross-border outbreaks and for the development of international standardised risk assessments of food-borne microorganisms.},

Logical components of the overall system were identified and technical requirements were prioritised and grouped according to functionality. Eleven platforms (solutions) that integrate the relevant functionalities for collecting, analysing and visualising WGS data were thoroughly described. The degree to which the requirements are met by the different solutions (as of 31 December 2018) was evaluated. The assessment made clear that no single solution meets all the critical requirements and each solution has significant gaps regarding the unmet critical requirements. Therefore, scenarios consisting of a combination of several solutions were considered. As there may be many suitable scenarios, and the choice among them will depend on strategic or financial elements that are not within the scope of this report, it contains the scientific and technical elements necessary to generate scenarios, rather proposing individual scenarios. A scenario builder is presented which includes the significant gaps for each solution/functionality and the limitations and risks to be considered when setting up a joint ECDC-EFSA database for the collection and analysis of WGS data.},

	abstract = {Background  In the context of pathogen surveillance, it is crucial to ensure interoperability and harmonized data. Several surveillance systems are designed to compare bacteria and identify outbreak clusters based on core genome MultiLocus Sequence Typing (cgMLST). Among the different approaches available to generate bacterial cgMLST, our research used an assembly-based approach (chewBBACA tool).
Methods  Simulations of short-read sequencing were conducted for 5 genomes of 27 pathogens of interest in animal, plant, and human health to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of cgMLST. Various quality parameters, such as read quality and depth of sequencing were applied, and several read simulations and genome assemblies were repeated using three tools: SPAdes, Unicycler and Shovill. In vitro sequencing were also used to evaluate assembly impact on cgMLST results, for six bacterial species: Bacillus thuringiensis, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Xylella fastidiosa.
Results  The results highlighted variability in cgMLST, which not only related to the assembly tools, but also induced by the intrinsic composition of the genomes themselves. This variability observed in simulated sequencing was further validated with real data for six of the bacterial pathogens studied.
Conclusion  This highlights that the intrinsic genome composition affects assembly and resulting cgMLST profiles, and that variability in bioinformatics tools can induce a bias in cgMLST profiles. In conclusion, we propose that the completeness of cgMLST schemes should be considered when clustering strains.},

The Ebola and Zika epidemics are the latest to demonstrate that pathogens often spread undetected for some time before being diagnosed in a population.Next-generation sequencing, particularly the use of portable genomic sequencers, offers an intriguing solution to the diagnosis and surveillance problems — it enables rapid in situ diagnostics through amplicon-based or metagenomics approaches and creates a stream of genomic data that can reveal critical epidemiological aspects of an outbreak or epidemic's dynamics.Genomic epidemiology for rapid outbreak response has demonstrated some early successes in Ebola and Zika, but there are a number of challenges to overcome — some technical and some cultural. Data sharing is one of these, but other ethical and legal issues must be considered.The power of a genomic epidemiology approach could be extended by incorporating concepts from digital disease detection and One Health. By coupling sequencing to an enhanced surveillance and response platform, we could take a more anticipatory approach to outbreak prevention and control.},

Over the last fifty years large numbers of researchers have applied themselves to the production of techniques and technologies to facilitate this feat, sequencing DNA and RNA molecules.

This is especially the case for bacteria exhibiting high levels of antibiotic resistance or virulence, and those involved in nosocomial or pandemic infections. Strain typing also has applications in studying bacterial population dynamics. Over the last two decades, molecular methods have progressively replaced phenotypic assays to type bacterial strains. In this article, we review the current bacterial genotyping methods and classify them into three main categories: (1) DNA banding pattern-based methods, which classify bacteria according to the size of fragments generated by amplification and/or enzymatic digestion of genomic DNA, (2) DNA sequencing-based methods, which study the polymorphism of DNA sequences, and (3) DNA hybridization-based methods using nucleotidic probes. We described and compared the applications of genotyping methods to the study of bacterial strain diversity. We also discussed the selection of appropriate genotyping methods and the challenges of bacterial strain typing, described the current trends of genotyping methods, and investigated the progresses allowed by the availability of genomic sequences.},

Next generation sequencing (NGS) determines the DNA sequence of a complete bacterial genome in a single sequence run, and from these data, information on resistance and virulence, as well as information for typing is obtained, useful for outbreak investigation. The obtained genome data can be further used for the development of an outbreak-specific screening test. In this review, a general introduction to NGS is presented, including the library preparation and the major characteristics of the most common NGS platforms, such as the MiSeq (Illumina) and the Ion PGM™ (ThermoFisher). An overview of the software used for NGS data analyses used at the medical microbiology diagnostic laboratory in the University Medical Center Groningen in The Netherlands is given. Furthermore, applications of NGS in the clinical setting are described, such as outbreak management, molecular case finding, characterization and surveillance of pathogens, rapid identification of bacteria using the 16S-23S rRNA region, taxonomy, metagenomics approaches on clinical samples, and the determination of the transmission of zoonotic micro-organisms from animals to humans. Finally, we share our vision on the use of NGS in personalised microbiology in the near future, pointing out specific requirements.},

PubMLST.org website hosts a collection of open-access, curated databases that integrate population sequence data with provenance and phenotype information for over 100 different microbial species and genera.  Although the PubMLST website was conceived as part of the development of the first multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme in 1998 the software it uses, the Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence database (BIGSdb, published in 2010), enables PubMLST to include all levels of sequence data, from single gene sequences up to and including complete, finished genomes.  Here we describe developments in the BIGSdb software made from publication to June 2018 and show how the platform realises microbial population genomics for a wide range of applications.  The system is based on the gene-by-gene analysis of microbial genomes, with each deposited sequence annotated and curated to identify the genes present and systematically catalogue their variation.  Originally intended as a means of characterising isolates with typing schemes, the synthesis of sequences and records of genetic variation with provenance and phenotype data permits highly scalable (whole genome sequence data for tens of thousands of isolates) means of addressing a wide range of functional questions, including: the prediction of antimicrobial resistance; likely cross-reactivity with vaccine antigens; and the functional activities of different variants that lead to key phenotypes.  There are no limitations to the number of sequences, genetic loci, allelic variants or schemes (combinations of loci) that can be included, enabling each database to represent an expanding catalogue of the genetic variation of the population in question.  In addition to providing web-accessible analyses and links to third-party analysis and visualisation tools, the BIGSdb software includes a RESTful application programming interface (API) that enables access to all the underlying data for third-party applications and data analysis pipelines.},

	abstract = {No single genealogical reconstruction or typing method currently encompasses all levels of bacterial diversity, from domain to strain. We propose ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST), an approach which indexes variation of the 53 genes encoding the bacterial ribosome protein subunits (rps genes), as a means of integrating microbial genealogy and typing. As with multilocus sequence typing (MLST), rMLST employs curated reference sequences to identify gene variants efficiently and rapidly. The rps loci are ideal targets for a universal characterization scheme as they are: (i) present in all bacteria; (ii) distributed around the chromosome; and (iii) encode proteins which are under stabilizing selection for functional conservation. Collectively, the rps loci exhibit variation that resolves bacteria into groups at all taxonomic and most typing levels, providing significantly more resolution than 16S small subunit rRNA gene phylogenies. A web-accessible expandable database, comprising whole-genome data from more than 1900 bacterial isolates, including 28 draft genomes assembled de novo from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) sequence read archive, has been assembled. The rps gene variation catalogued in this database permits rapid and computationally non-intensive identification of the phylogenetic position of any bacterial sequence at the domain, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species and strain levels. The groupings generated with rMLST data are consistent with current nomenclature schemes and independent of the clustering algorithm used. This approach is applicable to the other domains of life, potentially providing a rational and universal approach to the classification of life that is based on one of its fundamental features, the translation mechanism.},

	abstract = {Molecular structures and sequences are generally more revealing of evolutionary relationships than are classical phenotypes (particularly so among microorganisms). Consequently, the basis for the definition of taxa has progressively shifted from the organismal to the cellular to the molecular level. Molecular comparisons show that life on this planet divides into three primary groupings, commonly known as the eubacteria, the archaebacteria, and the eukaryotes. The three are very dissimilar, the differences that separate them being of a more profound nature than the differences that separate typical kingdoms, such as animals and plants. Unfortunately, neither of the conventionally accepted views of the natural relationships among living systems--i.e., the five-kingdom taxonomy or the eukaryote-prokaryote dichotomy--reflects this primary tripartite division of the living world. To remedy this situation we propose that a formal system of organisms be established in which above the level of kingdom there exists a new taxon called a "domain." Life on this planet would then be seen as comprising three domains, the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eucarya, each containing two or more kingdoms. (The Eucarya, for example, contain Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and a number of others yet to be defined). Although taxonomic structure within the Bacteria and Eucarya is not treated herein, Archaea is formally subdivided into the two kingdoms Euryarchaeota (encompassing the methanogens and their phenotypically diverse relatives) and Crenarchaeota (comprising the relatively tight clustering of extremely thermophilic archaebacteria, whose general phenotype appears to resemble most the ancestral phenotype of the Archaea.},

The advancement of molecular techniques such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized the field of bacterial strain typing, with important implications for epidemiological surveillance and outbreak investigations. This review summarizes state-of-the-art techniques in strain typing and examines barriers faced by clinical and public health laboratories in implementing these new methodologies.

Recent findings
WGS-based methodologies are on track to become the new ‘gold standards’ in bacterial strain typing, replacing traditional methods like pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. These new techniques have an improved ability to identify genetic relationships among organisms of interest. Further, advances in long-read sequencing approaches will likely provide a highly discriminatory tool to perform pangenome analyses and characterize relevant accessory genome elements, including mobile genetic elements carrying antibiotic resistance determinants in real time. Barriers to widespread integration of these approaches include a lack of standardized workflows and technical training.

Summary
Genomic bacterial strain typing has facilitated a paradigm shift in clinical and molecular epidemiology. The increased resolution that these new techniques provide, along with epidemiological data, will facilitate the rapid identification of transmission routes with high confidence, leading to timely and effective deployment of infection control and public health interventions in outbreak settings.},

Each method has its advantages and drawbacks, but genotypic methods are more reliable and reproducible, with greater discriminatory power than the phenotypic ones.

The duration of the applied electrical pulses is varied from 1 sec to 90 sec to achieve optimal separations for DNAs with sizes from 30 to 2000 kb. This pulsed field gradient gel electrophoresis fractionates intact S. cerevisiae chromosomal DNA, producing a molecular karyotype that greatly facilitates the assignment of genes to yeast chromosomes. Each yeast chromosome consists of a single piece of DNA; the chromosome sizes are consistent with the genetic linkage map.

PFGE has enabled the rapid genomic analysis of microbes and mammalian cells, and motivated development of large-insert cloning systems such as bacterial and yeast artificial chromosomes. As such, this protocol includes descriptions of two types of PFGE instrumentation (not commercially available), along with detailed instructions for their operation.

Some of the methods used, however, required either a high level of technology and sophisticated equipment (e.g., pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) or species-specific reagents of restricted availability (randomly cloned DNA probes or gene-specific probes). Because ribotyping uses a universal probe (rRNA) and is a rather simple technology, particularly since the advent of nonradioactive labelling systems, it has been widely used for strain differentiation of most bacterial species involved in nosocomial outbreaks. In vitro and in vivo stability of the markers studied has been demonstrated. Although there may be limitation to this approach, ribotyping was found to be highly discriminative, particularly for typing members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Xanthomonas maltophilia. In many cases, it has improved the understanding of the mechanism of nosocomial acquisition of organisms by allowing a distinction between endogenous and exogenous infections. Among exogenous infections, it has distinguished between individual and epidemic strains, thus differentiating cross-infection from independent acquisition.},

Short sequence repeat (SSR) motifs are known to undergo frequent variation in the number of repeated units through cellular mechanisms most commonly active during chromosome replication. A class of SSRs, named variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs), has proven to be a suitable target for assessing genetic polymorphisms within bacterial species.

DESIGN: The method is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) following HaeII digestion of simultaneously amplified parts of the protein A gene, the coagulase gene, and the hypervariable region adjacent to mecA. A total of 46 MRSA initial isolates were analyzed, including 14 isolates from five countries; the six German epidemic strains; 16 isolates from the Frankfurt metropolitan area, which were known to be heterogeneous by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE); and 10 isolates obtained during three epidemics, all of which displayed an identical genotype.
RESULTS: Restriction analysis by PCR-RFLP permitted discrimination of 10 of 14 international isolates, all six German epidemic strains, and 15 of 16 national isolates. It also confirmed the homogeneous character of the 10 outbreak isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: This new and rapid PCR-RFLP typing method is an attractive tool in routine epidemiological surveillance. Its impressive characteristics are ease of performance and interpretation, while at the same time guaranteeing good discriminatory power, reproducibility, and typeability.},

	abstract = {A novel DNA fingerprinting technique called AFLP is described. The AFLP technique is based on the selective PCR amplification of restriction fragments from a total digest of genomic DNA. The technique involves three steps: (i) restriction of the DNA and ligation of oligonucleotide adapters, (ii) selective amplification of sets of restriction fragments, and (iii) gel analysis of the amplified fragments. PCR amplification of restriction fragments is achieved by using the adapter and restriction site sequence as target sites for primer annealing. The selective amplification is achieved by the use of primers that extend into the restriction fragments, amplifying only those fragments in which the primer extensions match the nucleotides flanking the restriction sites. Using this method, sets of restriction fragments may be visualized by PCR without knowledge of nucleotide sequence. The method allows the specific co-amplification of high numbers of restriction fragments. The number of fragments that can be analyzed simultaneously, however, is dependent on the resolution of the detection system. Typically 50-100 restriction fragments are amplified and detected on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The AFLP technique provides a novel and very powerful DNA fingerprinting technique for DNAs of any origin or complexity.},

	abstract = {The scientific, medical, and diagnostic communities have been presented the most powerful tool for quantitative nucleic acids analysis: real-time PCR [Bustin, S.A., 2004. A-Z of Quantitative PCR. IUL Press, San Diego, CA]. This new technique is a refinement of the original Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) developed by Kary Mullis and coworkers in the mid 80:ies [Saiki, R.K., et al., 1985. Enzymatic amplification of beta-globin genomic sequences and restriction site analysis for diagnosis of sickle cell anemia, Science 230, 1350], for which Kary Mullis was awarded the 1993 year's Nobel prize in Chemistry. By PCR essentially any nucleic acid sequence present in a complex sample can be amplified in a cyclic process to generate a large number of identical copies that can readily be analyzed. This made it possible, for example, to manipulate DNA for cloning purposes, genetic engineering, and sequencing. But as an analytical technique the original PCR method had some serious limitations. By first amplifying the DNA sequence and then analyzing the product, quantification was exceedingly difficult since the PCR gave rise to essentially the same amount of product independently of the initial amount of DNA template molecules that were present. This limitation was resolved in 1992 by the development of real-time PCR by Higuchi et al. [Higuchi, R., Dollinger, G., Walsh, P.S., Griffith, R., 1992. Simultaneous amplification and detection of specific DNA-sequences. Bio-Technology 10(4), 413-417]. In real-time PCR the amount of product formed is monitored during the course of the reaction by monitoring the fluorescence of dyes or probes introduced into the reaction that is proportional to the amount of product formed, and the number of amplification cycles required to obtain a particular amount of DNA molecules is registered. Assuming a certain amplification efficiency, which typically is close to a doubling of the number of molecules per amplification cycle, it is possible to calculate the number of DNA molecules of the amplified sequence that were initially present in the sample. With the highly efficient detection chemistries, sensitive instrumentation, and optimized assays that are available today the number of DNA molecules of a particular sequence in a complex sample can be determined with unprecedented accuracy and sensitivity sufficient to detect a single molecule. Typical uses of real-time PCR include pathogen detection, gene expression analysis, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, analysis of chromosome aberrations, and most recently also protein detection by real-time immuno PCR.},

The basic concept was to follow the activity of DNA polymerase during nucleotide incorporation into a DNA strand by analyzing the pyrophosphate released during the process. Today, the technique is used in multidisciplinary fields in academic, clinical, and industrial settings all over the word. This technique can be used for both single-base sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, depending on the format used.},

In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome. Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers ∼99\% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of ∼1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death. Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000–25,000 protein-coding genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead.},

Three basic elements used in the analysis of cDNA libraries are responsible for the high efficiency of this new approach: (1) high-density library arrays allowing thousands of clones to be screened simultaneously; (2) hybridization fingerprinting techniques to identify clones abundantly expressed in specific tissues (by hybridizations with labeled tissue cDNA pools) and to avoid the repeated selection of identical clones and of clones containing noncoding inserts; and (3) a computerized system for the evaluation of hybridization data. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we hybridized high-density cDNA library arrays of human fetal brain and embryonal Drosophila with radiolabeled cDNA pools derived from whole mouse tissues. Fingerprints of the library arrays were generated, localizing clones containing cDNA sequences from mRNAs expressed at middle to high abundance ({\textgreater} 0.1-0.15\%) in the respective tissue. Partial sequencing data from a number of clones abundantly expressed in several tissues were generated to demonstrate the value of the approach, especially for the selection of cDNA clones for the analyses of genomes based on expressed sequence tagged sites. Data obtained by the technique described will ultimately be correlated with additional transcriptional and sequence information for the same library clones and with genomic mapping information in a relational database.},

Microarrays of cDNA provide a powerful tool for studying these complex phenomena. The tumorigenic properties of a human melanoma cell line, UACC-903, can be suppressed by introduction of a normal human chromosome 6, resulting in a reduction of growth rate, restoration of contact inhibition, and suppression of both soft agar clonogenicity and tumorigenicity in nude mice. We used a high density microarray of 1,161 DNA elements to search for differences in gene expression associated with tumour suppression in this system. Fluorescent probes for hybridization were derived from two sources of cellular mRNA [UACC-903 and UACC-903(+6)] which were labelled with different fluors to provide a direct and internally controlled comparison of the mRNA levels corresponding to each arrayed gene. The fluorescence signals representing hybridization to each arrayed gene were analysed to determine the relative abundance in the two samples of mRNAs corresponding to each gene. Previously unrecognized alterations in the expression of specific genes provide leads for further investigation of the genetic basis of the tumorigenic phenotype of these cells.},

For hybridization arrays, the general approach is to immobilize gene-specific sequences (probes) on a solid state matrix (nylon membranes, glass microscope slides, silicon/ceramic chips). These sequences are then queried with labeled copies of nucleic acids from biological samples (targets). The underlying theory is that the greater the expression of a gene, the greater the amount of labeled target, and hence, the greater output signal. In spite of the simplicity of the experimental design, there are at least four different platforms and several different approaches to processing and labeling the biological samples. Moreover, investigators must also determine whether they will utilize commercially available arrays or generate their own. This review will cover the status of the hybridization array field with an eye toward underlying principles and available technologies. Future developments and technological trends will also be evaluated.},

In the sequencing procedure, immobilized single-stranded template was used in a repeated cycle of deoxynucleotide extension. Real-time signals in the ELIDA, proportional to the amount of incorporated nucleotide, were observed when complementary bases were incorporated. An increased signal-to-noise ratio was obtained by substitution of deoxyadenosine α-thiotriphosphate (dATPαS) for the natural deoxyadenosine triphosphate, dATPαS is efficiently used by the DNA polymerase, but is not recognized by the luciferase.

Over the past 18 months, 454 sequencing has led to a better understanding of the structure of the human genome, allowed the first non-Sanger sequence of an individual human and opened up new approaches to identify small RNAs.

Substitution of drugs included in the World Health Organization's first-line tuberculosis treatment regimen (rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide) with R207910 accelerated bactericidal activity, leading to complete culture conversion after 2 months of treatment in some combinations. A single dose of R207910 inhibited mycobacterial growth for 1 week. Plasma levels associated with efficacy in mice were well tolerated in healthy human volunteers.

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing technologies are revolutionizing human genomics, promising to yield draft genomes cheaply and quickly. One such technology has now been used to analyse much of the genetic code of a single individual — who happens to be James D. Watson. The procedure, which involves no cloning of the genomic DNA, makes use of the latest 454 parallel sequencing instrument. The sequence cost less than US\$1 million (and a mere two months) to produce, compared to the approximately US\$100 million reported for sequencing Craig Venter's genome by traditional methods. Still a major undertaking, but another step towards the goal of 'personalized genomes' and 'personalized medicine'.},

The key scientific advances were not disseminated in the standard fora. The developments outlined in this Perspective are reconstructed from past conversations with some of the inventors of NGS when they were exploring chemistries to sequence even just two bases. Although not privy then to those specific chemistries that finally worked, we suggest the potential problems encountered at each stage. Now that we know the chemistries that work, for the benefit of future generations of scientists, we chart how NGS was developed and thereby illustrate the rationale underlying the enabling chemistry that has impacted biology and indeed society in unprecedented ways.},

	abstract = {DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400–800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from {\textgreater}30× average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications.},

We have characterized the derivatized surfaces for the chemical attachment of oligonucleotides and evaluate the properties relevant for the amplification process: surface density, thermal stability towards thermocycling, functionalization reproducibility and storage stability. The derivatization process, first developed for glass slides, was then adapted to microfabricated glass channels containing integrated fluidic connections. This implementation resulted in an important reduction of reaction times, consumption of reagents and process automation. Innovative analytical methods for the characterization of attached DNA were developed for assessing the surface immobilized DNA content after amplification. The results obtained showed that the BTA chemistry is compatible and suitable for forming highly dense arrays of DNA colonies with optimal surface coverage of about 10 million colonies/cm(2) from the amplification of initial single-template DNA molecules immobilized. We also demonstrate that the dsDNA colonies generated can be quantitatively processed in situ by restriction enzymes digestion. DNA colonies generated using the BTA reagent can be used for further sequence analysis in an unprecedented parallel fashion for low-cost genomic studies.},

Our CCS method matches or exceeds the ability of short-read sequencing to detect small variants and structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the ‘genome in a bottle’ (GIAB) benchmark set. Nearly all (99.64\%) variants can be phased into haplotypes, further improving variant detection. De novo genome assembly using CCS reads alone produced a contiguous and accurate genome with a contig N50 of {\textgreater}15 megabases (Mb) and concordance of 99.997\%, substantially outperforming assembly with less-accurate long reads.},

	abstract = {Oxford Nanopore's third-generation single-molecule sequencing platform promises to decrease costs for reagents and instrumentation. After a 2-year hiatus following the initial announcement, the first devices have been released as part of an early access program. We explore the performance of this platform by resequencing the lambda phage genome, and amplicons from a snake venom gland transcriptome. Although the handheld MinION sequencer can generate more than 150 megabases of raw data in one run, at most a quarter of the resulting reads map to the reference, with less than average 10\% identity. Much of the sequence consists of insertion/deletion errors, or is seemingly without similarity to the template. Using the lambda phage data as an example, although the reads are long, averaging 5 kb, at best 890 ± 1932 bases per mapped read could be matched to the reference without soft clipping. In the course of a 36 h run on the MinION, it was possible to resequence the 48 kb lambda phage reference at 16× coverage. Currently, substantially larger projects would not be feasible using the MinION. Without increases in accuracy, which would be required for applications such as genome scaffolding and phasing, the current utility of the MinION appears limited. Library preparation requires access to a molecular laboratory, and is of similar complexity and cost to that of other next-generation sequencing platforms. The MinION is an exciting step in a new direction for single-molecule sequencing, though it will require dramatic decreases in error rates before it lives up to its promise.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: On 22 June 2011, 8 patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or bloody diarrhea were reported in France. All 8 were attendees of a community center event on 8 June near Bordeaux. Three Escherichia coli cases were confirmed by isolation of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O104:H4 stx2 aggR producing a cefotaximase (CTX-M) β-lactamase (STEC O104:H4); the same rare serotype caused the outbreak in Germany in May-July 2011. An investigation was initiated to describe the outbreak, identify the vehicle for infection, and guide control measures.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among all adults attending the event, including food handlers. A standardized questionnaire was administered to participants. A case was an attendee who developed HUS or diarrhea between 8 and 24 June. Cases were confirmed by isolation of STEC O104:H4 or O104 serology. Relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) by exposure were calculated using a Poisson regression model.
RESULTS: Twenty-four cases were identified (14\% attack rate). Of these, 18 (75\%) were women, 22 (92\%) were adults, 7 (29\%) developed HUS, 5 (21\%) developed bloody diarrhea, and 12 (50\%) developed diarrhea. Ten (42\%) cases were confirmed. Fenugreek was the only sprout type with an independent association to illness (RR, 5.1; 95\% CI, 2.3-11.1) in multivariable analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This investigation identified a point-source STEC O104:H4 outbreak associated with consumption of fenugreek sprouts. Comparison of results from French and German STEC O104:H4 outbreak investigations enabled identification of a common food vehicle, fenugreek sprouts, and resulted in implementation of Europe-wide control measures in July 2011.},

	abstract = {An ongoing outbreak of exceptionally virulent Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli O104:H4 centered in Germany, has caused over 830 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and 46 deaths since May 2011. Serotype O104:H4, which has not been detected in animals, has rarely been associated with HUS in the past. To prospectively elucidate the unique characteristics of this strain in the early stages of this outbreak, we applied whole genome sequencing on the Life Technologies Ion Torrent PGM™ sequencer and Optical Mapping to characterize one outbreak isolate (LB226692) and a historic O104:H4 HUS isolate from 2001 (01-09591). Reference guided draft assemblies of both strains were completed with the newly introduced PGM™ within 62 hours. The HUS-associated strains both carried genes typically found in two types of pathogenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Phylogenetic analyses of 1,144 core E. coli genes indicate that the HUS-causing O104:H4 strains and the previously published sequence of the EAEC strain 55989 show a close relationship but are only distantly related to common EHEC serotypes. Though closely related, the outbreak strain differs from the 2001 strain in plasmid content and fimbrial genes. We propose a model in which EAEC 55989 and EHEC O104:H4 strains evolved from a common EHEC O104:H4 progenitor, and suggest that by stepwise gain and loss of chromosomal and plasmid-encoded virulence factors, a highly pathogenic hybrid of EAEC and EHEC emerged as the current outbreak clone. In conclusion, rapid next-generation technologies facilitated prospective whole genome characterization in the early stages of an outbreak.},

A multiagency collaboration began performing real-time, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on all US Lm isolates from patients, food, and the environment in September 2013, posting sequencing data into a public repository. Compared with the year before the project began, WGS, combined with epidemiologic and product trace-back data, detected more listeriosis clusters and solved more outbreaks (2 outbreaks in pre-WGS year, 5 in WGS year 1, and 9 in year 2). Whole-genome multilocus sequence typing and single nucleotide polymorphism analyses provided equivalent phylogenetic relationships relevant to investigations; results were most useful when interpreted in context of epidemiological data.

For the past two decades, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was the gold standard subtyping method for the pathogens tracked by PulseNet. A new gold standard is now being implemented with the introduction of cost-effective whole genome sequencing (WGS) for analysis of all the organisms tracked by PulseNet. This transformation is a major undertaking that touches every functional aspect of PulseNet, including laboratory workflows, data storage, analysis management and data interpretation, and language used to communicate information (sequence profile nomenclature system). The benefits of implementing WGS go beyond improved discrimination and precision of the data; it provides an opportunity to determine strain characteristics typically obtained through resource-intensive traditional methodologies, for example, species identification, serotyping, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance profiling, all of which can be consolidated into a single WGS workflow. Such a strategy represents a major shift in the workflows currently practiced in most public health laboratories, but one that brings opportunities for streamlining surveillance activities for the network as a whole. In this study, we provide a brief summary of PulseNet's evolution the past decade along with a general description of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.},

However, the wide adoption of whole-genome sequencing also poses new challenges for public-health agencies that must adapt to support a new set of expertise, which means that the capacity to perform genomic data assembly and analysis has not expanded as widely as the adoption of sequencing itself. In this Perspective, we make recommendations for developing an accessible, unified informatic ecosystem to support pathogen genomic analysis in public-health agencies across income settings. We hope that the creation of this ecosystem will allow agencies to effectively and efficiently share data, workflows and analyses and thereby increase the reproducibility, accessibility and auditability of pathogen genomic analysis while also supporting agency autonomy.},

The project firstly attempted to identify existing flaws and needs, and then to provide applicable cross-sectorial solutions. The project focused in developing a platform for small countries with limited economical and personnel resources. To achieve these goals, we applied a user-centered design strategy involving the end-users, such as microbiologists in public health and veterinary authorities, in every step of the design, development and implementation phases. As a result, we delivered the INNUENDO Platform V1.0 (https://innuendo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a stand-alone, portable, open-source, end-to-end system for the management, analysis, and sharing of bacterial genomic data. The platform uses Nextflow workflow manager to assemble analytical software modules in species-specific protocols that can be run using a user-friendly interface. The reproducibility of the process is ensured by using Docker containers and throught the annotation of the whole process using an ontology. Several modules, available at https://github.com/TheInnuendoProject, have been developed including: genome assembly and species confirmation; fast genome clustering; in silico typing; standardized species-specific phylogenetic frameworks for Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli based on an innovative gene-by-gene methodology; quality control measures from raw reads to allele calling; reporting system; a built-in communication protocols and a strain classification system enabling smooth communication during outbreak investigation. As proof-of-concepts, the proposed solutions have been thoroughly tested in simulated outbreak conditions by several public health and veterinary agencies across Europe. The results have been widely disseminated through several channels (web-sites, scientific publications, organization of workshops). The INNUENDO Platform V1.0 is effectively one of the models for the usage of open-source software in genomic epidemiology.},

	abstract = {The PubMLST.org website hosts a collection of open-access, curated databases that integrate population sequence data with provenance and phenotype information for over 100 different microbial species and genera.  Although the PubMLST website was conceived as part of the development of the first multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme in 1998 the software it uses, the Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence database (BIGSdb, published in 2010), enables PubMLST to include all levels of sequence data, from single gene sequences up to and including complete, finished genomes.  Here we describe developments in the BIGSdb software made from publication to June 2018 and show how the platform realises microbial population genomics for a wide range of applications.  The system is based on the gene-by-gene analysis of microbial genomes, with each deposited sequence annotated and curated to identify the genes present and systematically catalogue their variation.  Originally intended as a means of characterising isolates with typing schemes, the synthesis of sequences and records of genetic variation with provenance and phenotype data permits highly scalable (whole genome sequence data for tens of thousands of isolates) means of addressing a wide range of functional questions, including: the prediction of antimicrobial resistance; likely cross-reactivity with vaccine antigens; and the functional activities of different variants that lead to key phenotypes.  There are no limitations to the number of sequences, genetic loci, allelic variants or schemes (combinations of loci) that can be included, enabling each database to represent an expanding catalogue of the genetic variation of the population in question.  In addition to providing web-accessible analyses and links to third-party analysis and visualisation tools, the BIGSdb software includes a RESTful application programming interface (API) that enables access to all the underlying data for third-party applications and data analysis pipelines.},

Here, we provide an overview of how EnteroBase works, what it can do, and its future prospects. EnteroBase has currently assembled more than 300,000 genomes from Illumina short reads from Salmonella, Escherichia, Yersinia, Clostridioides, Helicobacter, Vibrio, and Moraxella and genotyped those assemblies by core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). Hierarchical clustering of cgMLST sequence types allows mapping a new bacterial strain to predefined population structures at multiple levels of resolution within a few hours after uploading its short reads. Case Study 1 illustrates this process for local transmissions of Salmonella enterica serovar Agama between neighboring social groups of badgers and humans. EnteroBase also supports single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls from both genomic assemblies and after extraction from metagenomic sequences, as illustrated by Case Study 2 which summarizes the microevolution of Yersinia pestis over the last 5000 years of pandemic plague. EnteroBase can also provide a global overview of the genomic diversity within an entire genus, as illustrated by Case Study 3, which presents a novel, global overview of the population structure of all of the species, subspecies, and clades within Escherichia.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Streptococcus agalactiae [group B streptococci (GBS)] have been considered uniformly susceptible to penicillin. However, increasing reports from Asia and North America are documenting penicillin-non-susceptible GBS (PRGBS) with mutations in pbp genes. Here we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first two PRGBS isolates recovered in Europe (AC-13238-1 and AC-13238-2), isolated from the same patient.
METHODS: Two different colony morphologies of GBS were noted from a surgical abscess drainage sample. Both were serotyped and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by different methodologies. High-throughput sequencing was done to compare the isolates at the genomic level, to identify their capsular type and ST, to evaluate mutations in the pbp genes and to compare the isolates with the genomes of other PRGBS isolates sharing the same serotype and ST.
RESULTS: Isolates AC-13238-1 and AC-13238-2 presented MICs above the EUCAST and CLSI breakpoints for penicillin susceptibility. Both shared the capsular type Ia operon and ST23. Genomic analysis uncovered differences between the two isolates in seven genes, including altered pbp genes. Deduced amino acid sequences revealed critical substitutions in PBP2X in both isolates. Comparison with serotype Ia clonal complex 23 PRGBS from the USA reinforced the similarity between AC-13238-1 and AC-13238-2, and their divergence from the US strains.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the in-host evolution of β-lactam-resistant GBS, with two PRGBS variants being isolated from one patient.},

The pbp1bA641C change results in longer time needed for bacterial killing by antibiotic treatment and shows evidence of being under positive selection.

Phylogenetic and molecular analyses revealed that cbpJ had the highest codon rates to total numbers of codons under considerable negative selection among those examined. Our in vitro and in vivo assays indicated that CbpJ functions as a virulence factor in pneumococcal pneumonia by contributing to evasion of neutrophil killing. Deficiency of cbpL under relaxed selective pressure also caused a similar tendency but showed no significant difference in mouse intranasal infection. Thus, molecular evolutionary analysis is a powerful tool that reveals the importance of virulence factors in real-world infection and transmission, since calculations are performed based on bacterial genome diversity following transmission of infection in an uncontrolled population.},

As vaccination is primarily concerned with the interaction of biological molecules with the immune system, the utility of sequence data is not immediately obvious and, indeed, nucleotide sequence data are most effective when used to complement more conventional immunological approaches. Here, the impact of sequencing on the field of vaccinology will be illustrated with reference to the development and implementation of vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis (the meningococcus) over the 30-year period from the late-1980s to the late-2010s. Nucleotide sequence-based studies have been important in the fight against this aggressive pathogen largely because of its high genetic and antigenic diversity, properties that were only fully appreciated because of sequence-based studies. Five aspects will be considered, the use of sequence data to: (i) discover vaccine antigens; (ii) assess the diversity and distribution of vaccine antigens; (iii) determine the evolutionary and population biology of the organism and their implications for immunization; and (iv) develop molecular approaches to investigate pre- and post-vaccine pathogen populations to assess vaccine impact. One of the great advantages of nucleotide sequence data has been its scalability, which has meant that increasingly large data sets have been available, which has proved invaluable in the investigation of an organism as diverse and enigmatic as the meningococcus.},

RESULTS: With our years of experience in manually curating genomes for the Joint Genome Institute, we developed a new gene prediction algorithm called Prodigal (PROkaryotic DYnamic programming Gene-finding ALgorithm). With Prodigal, we focused specifically on the three goals of improved gene structure prediction, improved translation initiation site recognition, and reduced false positives. We compared the results of Prodigal to existing gene-finding methods to demonstrate that it met each of these objectives.
CONCLUSION: We built a fast, lightweight, open source gene prediction program called Prodigal http://compbio.ornl.gov/prodigal/. Prodigal achieved good results compared to existing methods, and we believe it will be a valuable asset to automated microbial annotation pipelines.},

	shorttitle = {Apollo},
	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa179},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Third-generation sequencing technologies can sequence long reads that contain as many as 2 million base pairs. These long reads are used to construct an assembly (i.e. the subject's genome), which is further used in downstream genome analysis. Unfortunately, third-generation sequencing technologies have high sequencing error rates and a large proportion of base pairs in these long reads is incorrectly identified. These errors propagate to the assembly and affect the accuracy of genome analysis. Assembly polishing algorithms minimize such error propagation by polishing or fixing errors in the assembly by using information from alignments between reads and the assembly (i.e. read-to-assembly alignment information). However, current assembly polishing algorithms can only polish an assembly using reads from either a certain sequencing technology or a small assembly. Such technology-dependency and assembly-size dependency require researchers to (i) run multiple polishing algorithms and (ii) use small chunks of a large genome to use all available readsets and polish large genomes, respectively.
RESULTS: We introduce Apollo, a universal assembly polishing algorithm that scales well to polish an assembly of any size (i.e. both large and small genomes) using reads from all sequencing technologies (i.e. second- and third-generation). Our goal is to provide a single algorithm that uses read sets from all available sequencing technologies to improve the accuracy of assembly polishing and that can polish large genomes. Apollo (i) models an assembly as a profile hidden Markov model (pHMM), (ii) uses read-to-assembly alignment to train the pHMM with the Forward-Backward algorithm and (iii) decodes the trained model with the Viterbi algorithm to produce a polished assembly. Our experiments with real readsets demonstrate that Apollo is the only algorithm that (i) uses reads from any sequencing technology within a single run and (ii) scales well to polish large assemblies without splitting the assembly into multiple parts.

	abstract = {We have employed whole genome sequencing to define and evaluate a core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) scheme for Acinetobacter baumannii. To define a core genome we downloaded a total of 1,573 putative A. baumannii genomes from NCBI as well as representative isolates belonging to the eight previously described international A. baumannii clonal lineages. The core genome was then employed against a total of fifty-three carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates that were previously typed by PFGE and linked to hospital outbreaks in eight German cities. We defined a core genome of 2,390 genes of which an average 98.4\% were called successfully from 1,339 A. baumannii genomes, while Acinetobacter nosocomialis, Acinetobacter pittii, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus resulted in 71.2\%, 33.3\%, and 23.2\% good targets, respectively. When tested against the previously identified outbreak strains, we found good correlation between PFGE and cgMLST clustering, with 0-8 allelic differences within a pulsotype, and 40-2,166 differences between pulsotypes. The highest number of allelic differences was between the isolates representing the international clones. This typing scheme was highly discriminatory and identified separate A. baumannii outbreaks. Moreover, because a standardised cgMLST nomenclature is used, the system will allow inter-laboratory exchange of data.},
