	abstract = {Motivation: Metagenomics is a powerful approach to study genetic content of environmental samples, which has been strongly promoted by next-generation sequencing technologies. To cope with massive data involved in modern metagenomic projects, recent tools rely on the analysis of k-mers shared between the read to be classified and sampled reference genomes.Results: Within this general framework, we show that spaced seeds provide a significant improvement of classification accuracy, as opposed to traditional contiguous k-mers.

The combination between local analyses and a public repository of allelic data strikes a balance between potential confidentiality issues and the need to compare results. The possibility of deploying private instances of chewie-NS facilitates the creation of nomenclature servers with a restricted user base to allow compliance with the strictest data policies. Chewie-NS allows users to easily share their own schemas and to explore publicly available schemas, including informative statistics on schemas and loci presented in interactive charts and tables. Users can retrieve all the information necessary to run a schema locally or all the alleles identified at a particular locus. The integration with the chewBBACA suite enables users to directly upload new schemas to chewie-NS, download existing schemas and synchronize local and remote schemas from chewBBACA command line version, allowing an easier integration into high-throughput analysis pipelines. The same REST API linking chewie-NS and the chewBBACA suite supports the interaction of other interfaces or pipelines with the databases available at chewie-NS, facilitating the reusability of the stored data.},

	abstract = {Streptococcus pyogenes is a major human pathogen with high genetic diversity, largely created by recombination and horizontal gene transfer, making it difficult to use single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome-wide analyses for surveillance. Using a gene-by-gene approach on 208 complete genomes of S. pyogenes, a novel whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) schema was developed, comprising 3,044 target loci. The schema was used for core-genome MLST (cgMLST) analyses of previously published data sets and 265 newly sequenced draft genomes with other molecular and phenotypic typing data. Clustering based on cgMLST data supported the genetic heterogeneity of many emm types and correlated poorly with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis macrorestriction profiling, superantigen gene profiling, and MLST sequence type, highlighting the limitations of older typing methods. While 763 loci were present in all isolates of a data set representative of S. pyogenes genetic diversity, the proposed schema allows scalable cgMLST analysis, which can include more loci for an increased resolution when typing closely related isolates. The cgMLST and PopPUNK clusters were broadly consistent in this diverse population. The cgMLST analyses presented results comparable to those of SNP-based methods in the identification of two recently emerged sublineages of emm1 and emm89 and the clarification of the genetic relatedness among isolates recovered in outbreak contexts. The schema was thoroughly annotated and made publicly available on the chewie-NS online platform (https://chewbbaca.online/species/1/schemas/1), providing a framework for high-resolution typing and analyzing the genetic variability of loci of particular biological interest.},

A dominant method of such string matching is the 'seed-and-extend' approach, in which occurrences of short subsequences called 'seeds' are used to search for potentially longer matches in a large database of sequences. Each such potential match is then checked to see if it extends beyond the seed. To be effective, the seed-and-extend approach needs to catalogue seeds from virtually every substring in the database of search strings. Projects such as mammalian genome assemblies and large-scale protein matching, however, have such large sequence databases that the resulting list of seeds cannot be stored in RAM on a single computer. This significantly slows the matching process.
RESULTS: We present a simple and elegant method in which only a small fraction of seeds, called 'minimizers', needs to be stored. Using minimizers can speed up string-matching computations by a large factor while missing only a small fraction of the matches found using all seeds.},

	abstract = {Arcobacter butzleri is a foodborne emerging human pathogen, frequently displaying a multidrug resistant character. Still, the lack of comprehensive genome-scale comparative analysis has limited our knowledge on A. butzleri diversification and pathogenicity. Here, we performed a deep genome analysis of A. butzleri focused on decoding its core- and pan-genome diversity and specific genetic traits underlying its pathogenic potential and diverse ecology. A. butzleri (genome size 2.07–2.58 Mbp) revealed a large open pan-genome with 7474 genes (about 50\% being singletons) and a small but diverse core-genome with 1165 genes. It presents a plastic virulome (including newly identified determinants), marked by the differential presence of multiple adaptation-related virulence factors, such as the urease cluster ureD(AB)CEFG (phenotypically confirmed), the hypervariable hemagglutinin-encoding hecA, a type I secretion system (T1SS) harboring another agglutinin and a novel VirB/D4 T4SS likely linked to interbacterial competition and cytotoxicity. In addition, A. butzleri harbors a large repertoire of efflux pumps (EPs) and other antibiotic resistant determinants. We unprecedentedly describe a genetic mechanism of A. butzleri macrolides resistance, (inactivation of a TetR repressor likely regulating an EP). Fluoroquinolones resistance correlated with Thr-85-Ile in GyrA and ampicillin resistance was linked to an OXA-15-like β-lactamase. Remarkably, by decoding the polymorphism pattern of the main antigen PorA, we show that A. butzleri is able to exchange porA as a whole and/or hypervariable epitope-encoding regions separately, leading to a multitude of chimeric PorA presentations that can impact pathogen-host interaction during infection. Ultimately, our unprecedented screening of short sequence repeats indicates that phase variation likely modulates A. butzleri key adaptive functions. In summary, this study constitutes a turning point on A. butzleri comparative genomics revealing that this human gastrointestinal pathogen is equipped with vast and diverse virulence and antibiotic resistance arsenals that open a multitude of phenotypic fingerprints for environmental/host adaptation and pathogenicity.},

	abstract = {k-mer-based methods are widely used in bioinformatics for various types of sequence comparisons. However, a single mutation will mutate k consecutive k-mers and make most k-mer-based applications for sequence comparison sensitive to variable mutation rates. Many techniques have been studied to overcome this sensitivity, for example, spaced k-mers and k-mer permutation techniques, but these techniques do not handle indels well. For indels, pairs or groups of small k-mers are commonly used, but these methods first produce k-mer matches, and only in a second step, a pairing or grouping of k-mers is performed. Such techniques produce many redundant k-mer matches owing to the size of k. Here, we propose strobemers as an alternative to k-mers for sequence comparison. Intuitively, strobemers consist of two or more linked shorter k-mers, where the combination of linked k-mers is decided by a hash function. We use simulated data to show that strobemers provide more evenly distributed sequence matches and are less sensitive to different mutation rates than k-mers and spaced k-mers. Strobemers also produce higher match coverage across sequences. We further implement a proof-of-concept sequence-matching tool StrobeMap and use synthetic and biological Oxford Nanopore sequencing data to show the utility of using strobemers for sequence comparison in different contexts such as sequence clustering and alignment scenarios.},

Improvements are greater than what could be achieved by just increasing the length of contiguous k-mers. Effect sizes are particularly large for low coverage data.

Arguably the most well-known and common method is the minimizer technique, which selects the ‘lowest-ordered’ k-mer in a sliding window. Recently, it has been shown that minimizers may be a sub-optimal method for selecting subsets of k-mers when mutations are present. There is, however, a lack of understanding behind the theory of why certain methods perform well.We first theoretically investigate the conservation metric for k-mer selection methods. We derive an exact expression for calculating the conservation of a k-mer selection method. This turns out to be tractable enough for us to prove closed-form expressions for a variety of methods, including (open and closed) syncmers, (a, b, n)-words, and an upper bound for minimizers. As a demonstration of our results, we modified the minimap2 read aligner to use a more conserved k-mer selection method and demonstrate that there is up to an 8.2\% relative increase in number of mapped reads. However, we found that the k-mers selected by more conserved methods are also more repetitive, leading to a runtime increase during alignment. We give new insight into how one might use new k-mer selection methods as a reparameterization to optimize for speed and alignment quality.Simulations and supplementary methods are available at https://github.com/bluenote-1577/local-kmer-selection-results. os-minimap2 is a modified version of minimap2 and available at https://github.com/bluenote-1577/os-minimap2.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

It is parameterized by the k-mer length k, a window length w and an order on the k-mers. Minimizers are used in a large number of softwares and pipelines to improve computation efficiency and decrease memory usage. Despite the method’s popularity, many theoretical questions regarding its performance remain open. The core metric for measuring performance of a minimizer is the density, which measures the sparsity of sampled k-mers. The theoretical optimal density for a minimizer is 1/w, provably not achievable in general. For given k and w, little is known about asymptotically optimal minimizers, that is minimizers with density O(1/w).We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of asymptotically optimal minimizers. We also provide a randomized algorithm, called the Miniception, to design minimizers with the best theoretical guarantee to date on density in practical scenarios. Constructing and using the Miniception is as easy as constructing and using a random minimizer, which allows the design of efficient minimizers that scale to the values of k and w used in current bioinformatics software programs.Reference implementation of the Miniception and the codes for analysis can be found at https://github.com/kingsford-group/miniception.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Randstrobes, the most sensitive strobemer proposed in [Sahlin, 2021a], has been used in several bioinformatics applications such as read classification, short read mapping, and read overlap detection. Recently, we showed that the more pseudo-random the behavior of the construction (measured in entropy), the more efficient the seeds for sequence similarity analysis. The level of pseudo-randomness depends on the construction operators, but no study has investigated the efficacy.In this study, we introduce novel construction methods, including a Binary Search Tree (BST)-based approach that improves time complexity over previous methods. To our knowledge, we are also the first to address biases in construction and design three metrics for measuring bias. Our evaluation shows that our methods have favorable speed and sampling uniformity compared to existing approaches. Lastly, guided by our results, we change the seed construction in strobealign, a short-read mapper, and find that the results change substantially. We suggest combining the two results to improve strobealign’s accuracy for the shortest reads in our evaluated datasets. Our evaluation highlights sampling biases that can occur and provides guidance on which operators to use when implementing randstrobes.All methods and evaluation benchmarks are available in a public Github repository at https://github.com/Moein-Karami/RandStrobes. The scripts for running the strobealign analysis are found at https://github.com/NBISweden/strobealign-evaluation.},

In addition, its highly discriminative power enables the comparison of genetic relatedness between bacteria even on a sub-species level. For this reason, WGS is being implemented worldwide and across sectors (human, veterinary, food, and environment) for the investigation of disease outbreaks, source attribution, and improved risk characterization models. In order to extract relevant information from the large quantity and complex data produced by WGS, a host of bioinformatics tools has been developed, allowing users to analyze and interpret sequencing data, starting from simple gene-searches to complex phylogenetic studies. Depending on the research question, the complexity of the dataset and their bioinformatics skill set, users can choose between a great variety of tools for the analysis of WGS data. In this review, we describe the relevant approaches for phylogenomic studies for outbreak studies and give an overview of selected tools for the characterization of foodborne pathogens based on WGS data. Despite the efforts of the last years, harmonization and standardization of typing tools are still urgently needed to allow for an easy comparison of data between laboratories, moving towards a one health worldwide surveillance system for foodborne pathogens.},

	abstract = {Defining the population structure of a pathogen is a key part of epidemiology, as genomically related isolates are likely to share key clinical features such as antimicrobial resistance profiles and invasiveness. Multiple different methods are currently used to cluster together closely related genomes, potentially leading to inconsistency between studies. Here, we use a global dataset of 26 306 Streptococcus pneumoniae genomes to compare four clustering methods: gene-by-gene seven-locus MLST, core genome MLST (cgMLST)-based hierarchical clustering (HierCC) assignments, life identification number (LIN) barcoding and k-mer-based PopPUNK clustering (known as GPSCs in this species). We compare the clustering results with phylogenetic and pan-genome analyses to assess their relationship with genome diversity and evolution, as we would expect a good clustering method to form a single monophyletic cluster that has high within-cluster similarity of genomic content. We show that the four methods are generally able to accurately reflect the population structure based on these metrics and that the methods were broadly consistent with each other. We investigated further to study the discrepancies in clusters. The greatest concordance was seen between LIN barcoding and HierCC (adjusted mutual information score=0.950), which was expected given that both methods utilize cgMLST, but have different methods for defining an individual cluster and different core genome schema. However, the existence of differences between the two methods shows that the selection of a core genome schema can introduce inconsistencies between studies. GPSC and HierCC assignments were also highly concordant (AMI=0.946), showing that k-mer-based methods which use the whole genome and do not require the careful selection of a core genome schema are just as effective at representing the population structure. Additionally, where there were differences in clustering between these methods, this could be explained by differences in the accessory genome that were not identified in cgMLST. We conclude that for S. pneumoniae, standardized and stable nomenclature is important as the number of genomes available expands. Furthermore, the research community should transition away from seven-locus MLST, whilst cgMLST, GPSC and LIN assignments should be used more widely. However, to allow for easy comparison between studies and to make previous literature relevant, the reporting of multiple clustering names should be standardized within the research.},

The authorisation process requires a risk assessment in order to establish the safety and/or the efficacy of the microorganism(s) when used in the food chain as such, as biomasses or as production strains. This includes a full molecular characterisation of the microorganism(s) under assessment. For certain regulated products, the use of whole genome sequence (WGS) data of the microorganism is established as a requirement for the risk assessment. In this regard, data obtained from WGS analysis can provide information on the unambiguous taxonomic identification of the strains, on the presence of genes of concern (e.g. those encoding virulence factors, resistance to antimicrobials of clinical relevance for humans and animals, production of harmful metabolites or of clinically relevant antimicrobials) and on the characterisation of genetic modification(s) (where relevant). This document provides recommendations to applicants on how to describe and report the results of WGS analyses in the context of an application for market authorisation of a regulated product. Indications are given on how to perform genome sequencing and the quality criteria/thresholds that should be reached, as well as the data and relevant information that need to be reported, if required.

	abstract = {Accurately identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from bacterial sequencing data is an essential requirement for using genomics to track transmission and predict important phenotypes such as antimicrobial resistance. However, most previous performance evaluations of SNP calling have been restricted to eukaryotic (human) data. Additionally, bacterial SNP calling requires choosing an appropriate reference genome to align reads to, which, together with the bioinformatic pipeline, affects the accuracy and completeness of a set of SNP calls obtained. This study evaluates the performance of 209 SNP-calling pipelines using a combination of simulated data from 254 strains of 10 clinically common bacteria and real data from environmentally sourced and genomically diverse isolates within the genera Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, and Klebsiella.We evaluated the performance of 209 SNP-calling pipelines, aligning reads to genomes of the same or a divergent strain. Irrespective of pipeline, a principal determinant of reliable SNP calling was reference genome selection. Across multiple taxa, there was a strong inverse relationship between pipeline sensitivity and precision, and the Mash distance (a proxy for average nucleotide divergence) between reads and reference genome. The effect was especially pronounced for diverse, recombinogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli but less dominant for clonal species such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.The accuracy of SNP calling for a given species is compromised by increasing intra-species diversity. When reads were aligned to the same genome from which they were sequenced, among the highest-performing pipelines was Novoalign/GATK. By contrast, when reads were aligned to particularly divergent genomes, the highest-performing pipelines often used the aligners NextGenMap or SMALT, and/or the variant callers LoFreq, mpileup, or Strelka.},

However, the choice of a reference may represent a source of errors that may affect subsequent analyses such as the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phylogenetic inference. In this work, we evaluated the effect of reference choice on short-read sequence data from five clinically and epidemiologically relevant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens). Publicly available whole-genome assemblies encompassing the genomic diversity of these species were selected as reference sequences, and read alignment statistics, SNP calling, recombination rates, dN/dS ratios, and phylogenetic trees were evaluated depending on the mapping reference. The choice of different reference genomes proved to have an impact on almost all the parameters considered in the five species. In addition, these biases had potential epidemiological implications such as including/excluding isolates of particular clades and the estimation of genetic distances. These findings suggest that the single reference approach might introduce systematic errors during mapping that affect subsequent analyses, particularly for data sets with isolates from genetically diverse backgrounds. In any case, exploring the effects of different references on the final conclusions is highly recommended.},

	abstract = {The minimizers scheme is a method for selecting k-mers from sequences. It is used in many bioinformatics software tools to bin comparable sequences or to sample a sequence in a deterministic fashion at approximately regular intervals, in order to reduce memory consumption and processing time. Although very useful, the minimizers selection procedure has undesirable behaviors (e.g. too many k-mers are selected when processing certain sequences). Some of these problems were already known to the authors of the minimizers technique, and the natural lexicographic ordering of k-mers used by minimizers was recognized as their origin. Many software tools using minimizers employ ad hoc variations of the lexicographic order to alleviate those issues.We provide an in-depth analysis of the effect of k-mer ordering on the performance of the minimizers technique. By using small universal hitting sets (a recently defined concept), we show how to significantly improve the performance of minimizers and avoid some of its worse behaviors. Based on these results, we encourage bioinformatics software developers to use an ordering based on a universal hitting set or, if not possible, a randomized ordering, rather than the lexicographic order. This analysis also settles negatively a conjecture (by Schleimer et al.) on the expected density of minimizers in a random sequence.The software used for this analysis is available on GitHub: https://github.com/gmarcais/minimizers.git.},

	abstract = {Background
Since 2014, England has seen increased scarlet fever activity unprecedented in modern times. In 2016, England's scarlet fever seasonal rise coincided with an unexpected elevation in invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infections. We describe the molecular epidemiological investigation of these events.
Methods
We analysed changes in S pyogenes emm genotypes, and notifications of scarlet fever and invasive disease in 2014–16 using regional (northwest London) and national (England and Wales) data. Genomes of 135 non-invasive and 552 invasive emm1 isolates from 2009–16 were analysed and compared with 2800 global emm1 sequences. Transcript and protein expression of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA; also known as scarlet fever or erythrogenic toxin A) in sequenced, non-invasive emm1 isolates was quantified by real-time PCR and western blot analyses.
Findings
Coincident with national increases in scarlet fever and invasive disease notifications, emm1 S pyogenes upper respiratory tract isolates increased significantly in northwest London in the March to May period, from five (5\%) of 96 isolates in 2014, to 28 (19\%) of 147 isolates in 2015 (p=0·0021 vs 2014 values), to 47 (33\%) of 144 in 2016 (p=0·0080 vs 2015 values). Similarly, invasive emm1 isolates collected nationally in the same period increased from 183 (31\%) of 587 in 2015 to 267 (42\%) of 637 in 2016 (p{\textless}0·0001). Sequences of emm1 isolates from 2009–16 showed emergence of a new emm1 lineage (designated M1UK)—with overlap of pharyngitis, scarlet fever, and invasive M1UK strains—which could be genotypically distinguished from pandemic emm1 isolates (M1global) by 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Median SpeA protein concentration in supernatant was nine-times higher among M1UK isolates (190·2 ng/mL [IQR 168·9–200·4]; n=10) than M1global isolates (20·9 ng/mL [0·0–27·3]; n=10; p{\textless}0·0001). M1UK expanded nationally to represent 252 (84\%) of all 299 emm1 genomes in 2016. Phylogenetic analysis of published datasets identified single M1UK isolates in Denmark and the USA.
Interpretation
A dominant new emm1 S pyogenes lineage characterised by increased SpeA production has emerged during increased S pyogenes activity in England. The expanded reservoir of M1UK and recognised invasive potential of emm1 S pyogenes provide plausible explanation for the increased incidence of invasive disease, and rationale for global surveillance.

	abstract = {Background We recently described FastTree, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to FastTree that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability. Methodology/Principal Findings Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the “CAT” approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100–1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory. Conclusions/Significance FastTree 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments. FastTree 2 is freely available at http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

Our tool compresses the genomes significantly better than the existing programs and is much faster. Moreover, its unique feature is the ability to access any contig (or its part) in a fraction of a second and easily append new samples to the compressed collections. Thanks to this, AGC could be useful not only for backup or transfer purposes but also for routine analysis of pangenome sequences in common pipelines. With the rapidly reduced cost and improved accuracy of sequencing technologies, we anticipate more comprehensive pangenome projects with much larger sample sizes.

Genomic, DNA-DNA microarray, and single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses indicated that this clone evolved through a series of horizontal gene transfer events that involved (1) the acquisition of prophages encoding streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A and extracellular DNases and (2) the reciprocal recombination of a 36-kb chromosomal region encoding the extracellular toxins NAD+-glycohydrolase (NADase) and streptolysin O (SLO). These gene transfer events were associated with significantly increased production of SLO and NADase. Virtual identity in the 36-kb region present in contemporary serotype M1 and M12 isolates suggests that a serotype M12 strain served as the donor of this region. Multiple horizontal gene transfer events were a crucial factor in the evolutionary origin and emergence of a very abundant contemporary clone of serotype M1 GAS},

Sketching approaches entice with improved scalability but also carry the danger of decreased accuracy and added bias. In this article, we investigate the minimizer sketch and its use to estimate the Jaccard similarity between two sequences.We show that the minimizer Jaccard estimator is biased and inconsistent, which means that the expected difference (i.e. the bias) between the estimator and the true value is not zero, even in the limit as the lengths of the sequences grow. We derive an analytical formula for the bias as a function of how the shared k-mers are laid out along the sequences. We show both theoretically and empirically that there are families of sequences where the bias can be substantial (e.g. the true Jaccard can be more than double the estimate). Finally, we demonstrate that this bias affects the accuracy of the widely used mashmap read mapping tool.Scripts to reproduce our experiments are available at https://github.com/medvedevgroup/minimizer-jaccard-estimator/tree/main/reproduce.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {In a conventional view of the prokaryotic genome organization, promoters precede operons and ribosome binding sites (RBSs) with Shine-Dalgarno consensus precede genes. However, recent experimental research suggesting a more diverse view motivated us to develop an algorithm with improved gene-finding accuracy. We describe GeneMarkS-2, an ab initio algorithm that uses a model derived by self-training for finding species-specific (native) genes, along with an array of precomputed "heuristic" models designed to identify harder-to-detect genes (likely horizontally transferred). Importantly, we designed GeneMarkS-2 to identify several types of distinct sequence patterns (signals) involved in gene expression control, among them the patterns characteristic for leaderless transcription as well as noncanonical RBS patterns. To assess the accuracy of GeneMarkS-2, we used genes validated by COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) annotation, proteomics experiments, and N-terminal protein sequencing. We observed that GeneMarkS-2 performed better on average in all accuracy measures when compared with the current state-of-the-art gene prediction tools. Furthermore, the screening of ∼5000 representative prokaryotic genomes made by GeneMarkS-2 predicted frequent leaderless transcription in both archaea and bacteria. We also observed that the RBS sites in some species with leadered transcription did not necessarily exhibit the Shine-Dalgarno consensus. The modeling of different types of sequence motifs regulating gene expression prompted a division of prokaryotic genomes into five categories with distinct sequence patterns around the gene starts.},

We have developed a universal model of prokaryotic genes by fitting a temporal convolutional network to amino-acid sequences from a large, diverse set of microbial genomes.

	abstract = {Traditional and molecular typing schemes for the characterization of pathogenic microorganisms are poorly portable because they index variation that is difficult to compare among laboratories. To overcome these problems, we propose multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which exploits the unambiguous nature and electronic portability of nucleotide sequence data for the characterization of microorganisms. To evaluate MLST, we determined the sequences of ≈470-bp fragments from 11 housekeeping genes in a reference set of 107 isolates of Neisseria meningitidis from invasive disease and healthy carriers. For each locus, alleles were assigned arbitrary numbers and dendrograms were constructed from the pairwise differences in multilocus allelic profiles by cluster analysis. The strain associations obtained were consistent with clonal groupings previously determined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. A subset of six gene fragments was chosen that retained the resolution and congruence achieved by using all 11 loci. Most isolates from hyper-virulent lineages of serogroups A, B, and C meningococci were identical for all loci or differed from the majority type at only a single locus. MLST using six loci therefore reliably identified the major meningococcal lineages associated with invasive disease. MLST can be applied to almost all bacterial species and other haploid organisms, including those that are difficult to cultivate. The overwhelming advantage of MLST over other molecular typing methods is that sequence data are truly portable between laboratories, permitting one expanding global database per species to be placed on a World-Wide Web site, thus enabling exchange of molecular typing data for global epidemiology via the Internet.},

	abstract = {A range of methodologies may be used for analyzing bacteria, depending on the purpose and the level of resolution needed. The capability for recognition of species distinctions within the complex spectrum of bacterial diversity is necessary for progress in microbiological research. In clinical settings, accurate, rapid and cost-effective methods are essential for early and efficient treatment of infections. Characterization and identification of microorganisms, using, bottom-up proteomics, or “proteotyping”, relies on recognition of species-unique or associated peptides, by tandem mass spectrometry analyses, dependent upon an accurate and comprehensive foundation of genome sequence data, allowing for differentiation of species, at amino acid-level resolution. In this study, the high resolution and accuracy of MS/MS-based proteotyping was demonstrated, through analyses of the three phylogenetically and taxonomically most closely-related species of the Mitis Group of the genus Streptococcus: i.e., the pathogenic species, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), and the commensal species, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and Streptococcus mitis. To achieve high accuracy, a genome sequence database used for matching peptides was created and carefully curated. Here, MS-based, bottom-up proteotyping was observed and confirmed to attain the level of resolution necessary for differentiating and identifying the most-closely related bacterial species, as demonstrated by analyses of species of the Streptococcus Mitis Group, even when S. pneumoniae were mixed with S. pseudopneumoniae and S. mitis, by matching and identifying more than 200 unique peptides for each species.},

	abstract = {This Opinion considers the application of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and metagenomics for outbreak investigation, source attribution and risk assessment of food-borne pathogens. WGS offers the highest level of bacterial strain discrimination for food-borne outbreak investigation and source-attribution as well as potential for more precise hazard identification, thereby facilitating more targeted risk assessment and risk management. WGS improves linking of sporadic cases associated with different food products and geographical regions to a point source outbreak and can facilitate epidemiological investigations, allowing also the use of previously sequenced genomes. Source attribution may be favoured by improved identification of transmission pathways, through the integration of spatial-temporal factors and the detection of multidirectional transmission and pathogen–host interactions. Metagenomics has potential, especially in relation to the detection and characterisation of non-culturable, difficult-to-culture or slow-growing microorganisms, for tracking of hazard-related genetic determinants and the dynamic evaluation of the composition and functionality of complex microbial communities. A SWOT analysis is provided on the use of WGS and metagenomics for Salmonella and Shigatoxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) serotyping and the identification of antimicrobial resistance determinants in bacteria. Close agreement between phenotypic and WGS-based genotyping data has been observed. WGS provides additional information on the nature and localisation of antimicrobial resistance determinants and on their dissemination potential by horizontal gene transfer, as well as on genes relating to virulence and biological fitness. Interoperable data will play a major role in the future use of WGS and metagenomic data. Capacity building based on harmonised, quality controlled operational systems within European laboratories and worldwide is essential for the investigation of cross-border outbreaks and for the development of international standardised risk assessments of food-borne microorganisms.},

	abstract = {EFSA and ECDC were requested by the European Commission to jointly evaluate the possible solutions for the collection and analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data for at least Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella and Escherichia coli by: (1) analysing the outcome of the surveys on the status of the use of WGS of food-borne pathogens in EU/EEA countries in both the food and public health sectors; (2) conducting a consultation of relevant actors to assess state-of-the-art pipelines for collecting and analysing WGS data in Europe; (3) involving relevant stakeholders to assess the needs and requirements for the analysis of WGS data and their comparability; and (4) preparing a technical report on the identification and comparison of potential solutions for the set-up and running of a joint EFSA-ECDC pipeline to collect and analyse WGS data. Logical components of the overall system were identified and technical requirements were prioritised and grouped according to functionality. Eleven platforms (solutions) that integrate the relevant functionalities for collecting, analysing and visualising WGS data were thoroughly described. The degree to which the requirements are met by the different solutions (as of 31 December 2018) was evaluated. The assessment made clear that no single solution meets all the critical requirements and each solution has significant gaps regarding the unmet critical requirements. Therefore, scenarios consisting of a combination of several solutions were considered. As there may be many suitable scenarios, and the choice among them will depend on strategic or financial elements that are not within the scope of this report, it contains the scientific and technical elements necessary to generate scenarios, rather proposing individual scenarios. A scenario builder is presented which includes the significant gaps for each solution/functionality and the limitations and risks to be considered when setting up a joint ECDC-EFSA database for the collection and analysis of WGS data.},

	abstract = {Background  In the context of pathogen surveillance, it is crucial to ensure interoperability and harmonized data. Several surveillance systems are designed to compare bacteria and identify outbreak clusters based on core genome MultiLocus Sequence Typing (cgMLST). Among the different approaches available to generate bacterial cgMLST, our research used an assembly-based approach (chewBBACA tool).
Methods  Simulations of short-read sequencing were conducted for 5 genomes of 27 pathogens of interest in animal, plant, and human health to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of cgMLST. Various quality parameters, such as read quality and depth of sequencing were applied, and several read simulations and genome assemblies were repeated using three tools: SPAdes, Unicycler and Shovill. In vitro sequencing were also used to evaluate assembly impact on cgMLST results, for six bacterial species: Bacillus thuringiensis, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Xylella fastidiosa.
Results  The results highlighted variability in cgMLST, which not only related to the assembly tools, but also induced by the intrinsic composition of the genomes themselves. This variability observed in simulated sequencing was further validated with real data for six of the bacterial pathogens studied.
Conclusion  This highlights that the intrinsic genome composition affects assembly and resulting cgMLST profiles, and that variability in bioinformatics tools can induce a bias in cgMLST profiles. In conclusion, we propose that the completeness of cgMLST schemes should be considered when clustering strains.},

The Ebola and Zika epidemics are the latest to demonstrate that pathogens often spread undetected for some time before being diagnosed in a population.Next-generation sequencing, particularly the use of portable genomic sequencers, offers an intriguing solution to the diagnosis and surveillance problems — it enables rapid in situ diagnostics through amplicon-based or metagenomics approaches and creates a stream of genomic data that can reveal critical epidemiological aspects of an outbreak or epidemic's dynamics.Genomic epidemiology for rapid outbreak response has demonstrated some early successes in Ebola and Zika, but there are a number of challenges to overcome — some technical and some cultural. Data sharing is one of these, but other ethical and legal issues must be considered.The power of a genomic epidemiology approach could be extended by incorporating concepts from digital disease detection and One Health. By coupling sequencing to an enhanced surveillance and response platform, we could take a more anticipatory approach to outbreak prevention and control.},

This is especially the case for bacteria exhibiting high levels of antibiotic resistance or virulence, and those involved in nosocomial or pandemic infections. Strain typing also has applications in studying bacterial population dynamics. Over the last two decades, molecular methods have progressively replaced phenotypic assays to type bacterial strains. In this article, we review the current bacterial genotyping methods and classify them into three main categories: (1) DNA banding pattern-based methods, which classify bacteria according to the size of fragments generated by amplification and/or enzymatic digestion of genomic DNA, (2) DNA sequencing-based methods, which study the polymorphism of DNA sequences, and (3) DNA hybridization-based methods using nucleotidic probes. We described and compared the applications of genotyping methods to the study of bacterial strain diversity. We also discussed the selection of appropriate genotyping methods and the challenges of bacterial strain typing, described the current trends of genotyping methods, and investigated the progresses allowed by the availability of genomic sequences.},

The obtained genome data can be further used for the development of an outbreak-specific screening test. In this review, a general introduction to NGS is presented, including the library preparation and the major characteristics of the most common NGS platforms, such as the MiSeq (Illumina) and the Ion PGM™ (ThermoFisher). An overview of the software used for NGS data analyses used at the medical microbiology diagnostic laboratory in the University Medical Center Groningen in The Netherlands is given. Furthermore, applications of NGS in the clinical setting are described, such as outbreak management, molecular case finding, characterization and surveillance of pathogens, rapid identification of bacteria using the 16S-23S rRNA region, taxonomy, metagenomics approaches on clinical samples, and the determination of the transmission of zoonotic micro-organisms from animals to humans.

	abstract = {No single genealogical reconstruction or typing method currently encompasses all levels of bacterial diversity, from domain to strain. We propose ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST), an approach which indexes variation of the 53 genes encoding the bacterial ribosome protein subunits (rps genes), as a means of integrating microbial genealogy and typing. As with multilocus sequence typing (MLST), rMLST employs curated reference sequences to identify gene variants efficiently and rapidly. The rps loci are ideal targets for a universal characterization scheme as they are: (i) present in all bacteria; (ii) distributed around the chromosome; and (iii) encode proteins which are under stabilizing selection for functional conservation. Collectively, the rps loci exhibit variation that resolves bacteria into groups at all taxonomic and most typing levels, providing significantly more resolution than 16S small subunit rRNA gene phylogenies. A web-accessible expandable database, comprising whole-genome data from more than 1900 bacterial isolates, including 28 draft genomes assembled de novo from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) sequence read archive, has been assembled. The rps gene variation catalogued in this database permits rapid and computationally non-intensive identification of the phylogenetic position of any bacterial sequence at the domain, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species and strain levels. The groupings generated with rMLST data are consistent with current nomenclature schemes and independent of the clustering algorithm used. This approach is applicable to the other domains of life, potentially providing a rational and universal approach to the classification of life that is based on one of its fundamental features, the translation mechanism.},

	abstract = {Molecular structures and sequences are generally more revealing of evolutionary relationships than are classical phenotypes (particularly so among microorganisms). Consequently, the basis for the definition of taxa has progressively shifted from the organismal to the cellular to the molecular level. Molecular comparisons show that life on this planet divides into three primary groupings, commonly known as the eubacteria, the archaebacteria, and the eukaryotes. The three are very dissimilar, the differences that separate them being of a more profound nature than the differences that separate typical kingdoms, such as animals and plants. Unfortunately, neither of the conventionally accepted views of the natural relationships among living systems--i.e., the five-kingdom taxonomy or the eukaryote-prokaryote dichotomy--reflects this primary tripartite division of the living world. To remedy this situation we propose that a formal system of organisms be established in which above the level of kingdom there exists a new taxon called a "domain." Life on this planet would then be seen as comprising three domains, the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eucarya, each containing two or more kingdoms. (The Eucarya, for example, contain Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and a number of others yet to be defined). Although taxonomic structure within the Bacteria and Eucarya is not treated herein, Archaea is formally subdivided into the two kingdoms Euryarchaeota (encompassing the methanogens and their phenotypically diverse relatives) and Crenarchaeota (comprising the relatively tight clustering of extremely thermophilic archaebacteria, whose general phenotype appears to resemble most the ancestral phenotype of the Archaea.},

The advancement of molecular techniques such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized the field of bacterial strain typing, with important implications for epidemiological surveillance and outbreak investigations. This review summarizes state-of-the-art techniques in strain typing and examines barriers faced by clinical and public health laboratories in implementing these new methodologies.

Recent findings
WGS-based methodologies are on track to become the new ‘gold standards’ in bacterial strain typing, replacing traditional methods like pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. These new techniques have an improved ability to identify genetic relationships among organisms of interest. Further, advances in long-read sequencing approaches will likely provide a highly discriminatory tool to perform pangenome analyses and characterize relevant accessory genome elements, including mobile genetic elements carrying antibiotic resistance determinants in real time. Barriers to widespread integration of these approaches include a lack of standardized workflows and technical training.

Summary
Genomic bacterial strain typing has facilitated a paradigm shift in clinical and molecular epidemiology. The increased resolution that these new techniques provide, along with epidemiological data, will facilitate the rapid identification of transmission routes with high confidence, leading to timely and effective deployment of infection control and public health interventions in outbreak settings.},

	abstract = {Microbial typing (also known as “fingerprinting” or “characterization”) is a tool employed for years to identify organisms within a species. Different methods were developed, from the traditional phenotypic techniques such as biotyping and antibiogram typing, going through the PCR-based molecular methods, reaching the revolutionary sequencing techniques. Each method has its advantages and drawbacks, but genotypic methods are more reliable and reproducible, with greater discriminatory power than the phenotypic ones. Typing aims to serve various epidemiological, microbiological, and public health investigations. Choosing which method to use typically relies on many circumstances and factors, such as the study's cost, scale, and scope. This review collectively explains the principles of the various bacterial typing methods that have been commonly used throughout the years.},

The technique uses 1.5\% agarose, 10 to 20 micrograms of DNA per well, and low ionic strength buffers. It employs alternately pulsed, perpendicularly oriented electrical fields, at least one of which is inhomogeneous. The duration of the applied electrical pulses is varied from 1 sec to 90 sec to achieve optimal separations for DNAs with sizes from 30 to 2000 kb. This pulsed field gradient gel electrophoresis fractionates intact S. cerevisiae chromosomal DNA, producing a molecular karyotype that greatly facilitates the assignment of genes to yeast chromosomes. Each yeast chromosome consists of a single piece of DNA; the chromosome sizes are consistent with the genetic linkage map. We also describe a general method for preparing spheroplasts, and cell lysates, without significant chromosomal DNA breakage.},

PFGE has enabled the rapid genomic analysis of microbes and mammalian cells, and motivated development of large-insert cloning systems such as bacterial and yeast artificial chromosomes. As such, this protocol includes descriptions of two types of PFGE instrumentation (not commercially available), along with detailed instructions for their operation. Additionally, this protocol provides basic instructions for the preparation of intact chromosomal DNA from several types of organisms. PFGE takes 2-3 days, excluding sample preparation.},

Because ribotyping uses a universal probe (rRNA) and is a rather simple technology, particularly since the advent of nonradioactive labelling systems, it has been widely used for strain differentiation of most bacterial species involved in nosocomial outbreaks. In vitro and in vivo stability of the markers studied has been demonstrated. Although there may be limitation to this approach, ribotyping was found to be highly discriminative, particularly for typing members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Xanthomonas maltophilia. In many cases, it has improved the understanding of the mechanism of nosocomial acquisition of organisms by allowing a distinction between endogenous and exogenous infections. Among exogenous infections, it has distinguished between individual and epidemic strains, thus differentiating cross-infection from independent acquisition.},

DESIGN: The method is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) following HaeII digestion of simultaneously amplified parts of the protein A gene, the coagulase gene, and the hypervariable region adjacent to mecA. A total of 46 MRSA initial isolates were analyzed, including 14 isolates from five countries; the six German epidemic strains; 16 isolates from the Frankfurt metropolitan area, which were known to be heterogeneous by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE); and 10 isolates obtained during three epidemics, all of which displayed an identical genotype.
RESULTS: Restriction analysis by PCR-RFLP permitted discrimination of 10 of 14 international isolates, all six German epidemic strains, and 15 of 16 national isolates. It also confirmed the homogeneous character of the 10 outbreak isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: This new and rapid PCR-RFLP typing method is an attractive tool in routine epidemiological surveillance. Its impressive characteristics are ease of performance and interpretation, while at the same time guaranteeing good discriminatory power, reproducibility, and typeability.},

The technique involves three steps: (i) restriction of the DNA and ligation of oligonucleotide adapters, (ii) selective amplification of sets of restriction fragments, and (iii) gel analysis of the amplified fragments. PCR amplification of restriction fragments is achieved by using the adapter and restriction site sequence as target sites for primer annealing. The selective amplification is achieved by the use of primers that extend into the restriction fragments, amplifying only those fragments in which the primer extensions match the nucleotides flanking the restriction sites. Using this method, sets of restriction fragments may be visualized by PCR without knowledge of nucleotide sequence. The method allows the specific co-amplification of high numbers of restriction fragments. The number of fragments that can be analyzed simultaneously, however, is dependent on the resolution of the detection system. Typically 50-100 restriction fragments are amplified and detected on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The AFLP technique provides a novel and very powerful DNA fingerprinting technique for DNAs of any origin or complexity.},

A-Z of Quantitative PCR. IUL Press, San Diego, CA]. This new technique is a refinement of the original Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) developed by Kary Mullis and coworkers in the mid 80:ies [Saiki, R.K., et al., 1985. Enzymatic amplification of beta-globin genomic sequences and restriction site analysis for diagnosis of sickle cell anemia, Science 230, 1350], for which Kary Mullis was awarded the 1993 year's Nobel prize in Chemistry. By PCR essentially any nucleic acid sequence present in a complex sample can be amplified in a cyclic process to generate a large number of identical copies that can readily be analyzed. This made it possible, for example, to manipulate DNA for cloning purposes, genetic engineering, and sequencing. But as an analytical technique the original PCR method had some serious limitations. By first amplifying the DNA sequence and then analyzing the product, quantification was exceedingly difficult since the PCR gave rise to essentially the same amount of product independently of the initial amount of DNA template molecules that were present. This limitation was resolved in 1992 by the development of real-time PCR by Higuchi et al. [Higuchi, R., Dollinger, G., Walsh, P.S., Griffith, R., 1992. Simultaneous amplification and detection of specific DNA-sequences. Bio-Technology 10(4), 413-417]. In real-time PCR the amount of product formed is monitored during the course of the reaction by monitoring the fluorescence of dyes or probes introduced into the reaction that is proportional to the amount of product formed, and the number of amplification cycles required to obtain a particular amount of DNA molecules is registered. Assuming a certain amplification efficiency, which typically is close to a doubling of the number of molecules per amplification cycle, it is possible to calculate the number of DNA molecules of the amplified sequence that were initially present in the sample. With the highly efficient detection chemistries, sensitive instrumentation, and optimized assays that are available today the number of DNA molecules of a particular sequence in a complex sample can be determined with unprecedented accuracy and sensitivity sufficient to detect a single molecule. Typical uses of real-time PCR include pathogen detection, gene expression analysis, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, analysis of chromosome aberrations, and most recently also protein detection by real-time immuno PCR.},

We report the isolation and DNA sequence of several deletion prone exons from the human DMD gene. We also describe a rapid method capable of detecting the majority of deletions in the DMD gene. This procedure utilizes simultaneous genomic DNA amplification of multiple widely separated sequences and should permit deletion scanning at any hemizygous locus.

In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome. Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers ∼99\% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of ∼1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death. Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000–25,000 protein-coding genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead.},

Three basic elements used in the analysis of cDNA libraries are responsible for the high efficiency of this new approach: (1) high-density library arrays allowing thousands of clones to be screened simultaneously; (2) hybridization fingerprinting techniques to identify clones abundantly expressed in specific tissues (by hybridizations with labeled tissue cDNA pools) and to avoid the repeated selection of identical clones and of clones containing noncoding inserts; and (3) a computerized system for the evaluation of hybridization data. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we hybridized high-density cDNA library arrays of human fetal brain and embryonal Drosophila with radiolabeled cDNA pools derived from whole mouse tissues. Fingerprints of the library arrays were generated, localizing clones containing cDNA sequences from mRNAs expressed at middle to high abundance ({\textgreater} 0.1-0.15\%) in the respective tissue. Partial sequencing data from a number of clones abundantly expressed in several tissues were generated to demonstrate the value of the approach, especially for the selection of cDNA clones for the analyses of genomes based on expressed sequence tagged sites. Data obtained by the technique described will ultimately be correlated with additional transcriptional and sequence information for the same library clones and with genomic mapping information in a relational database.},

We used a high density microarray of 1,161 DNA elements to search for differences in gene expression associated with tumour suppression in this system. Fluorescent probes for hybridization were derived from two sources of cellular mRNA [UACC-903 and UACC-903(+6)] which were labelled with different fluors to provide a direct and internally controlled comparison of the mRNA levels corresponding to each arrayed gene. The fluorescence signals representing hybridization to each arrayed gene were analysed to determine the relative abundance in the two samples of mRNAs corresponding to each gene. Previously unrecognized alterations in the expression of specific genes provide leads for further investigation of the genetic basis of the tumorigenic phenotype of these cells.},

These sequences are then queried with labeled copies of nucleic acids from biological samples (targets). The underlying theory is that the greater the expression of a gene, the greater the amount of labeled target, and hence, the greater output signal. In spite of the simplicity of the experimental design, there are at least four different platforms and several different approaches to processing and labeling the biological samples. Moreover, investigators must also determine whether they will utilize commercially available arrays or generate their own.

The PPiformed in the DNA polymerase reaction is converted to ATP by ATP sulfurylase and the ATP production is continuously monitored by the firefly luciferase. In the sequencing procedure, immobilized single-stranded template was used in a repeated cycle of deoxynucleotide extension. Real-time signals in the ELIDA, proportional to the amount of incorporated nucleotide, were observed when complementary bases were incorporated. An increased signal-to-noise ratio was obtained by substitution of deoxyadenosine α-thiotriphosphate (dATPαS) for the natural deoxyadenosine triphosphate, dATPαS is efficiently used by the DNA polymerase, but is not recognized by the luciferase. As a model, 15 bases of a single-stranded PCR product were sequenced. The possibility for parallel processing of many samples in an automated manner is discussed.},

	abstract = {The 454 Sequencer has dramatically increased the volume of sequencing conducted by the scientific community and expanded the range of problems that can be addressed by the direct readouts of DNA sequence. Key breakthroughs in the development of the 454 sequencing platform included higher throughput, simplified all in vitro sample preparation and the miniaturization of sequencing chemistries, enabling massively parallel sequencing reactions to be carried out at a scale and cost not previously possible. Together with other recently released next-generation technologies, the 454 platform has started to democratize sequencing, providing individual laboratories with access to capacities that rival those previously found only at a handful of large sequencing centers. Over the past 18 months, 454 sequencing has led to a better understanding of the structure of the human genome, allowed the first non-Sanger sequence of an individual human and opened up new approaches to identify small RNAs. To make next-generation technologies more widely accessible, they must become easier to use and less costly. In the longer term, the principles established by 454 sequencing might reduce cost further, potentially enabling personalized genomics.},

In mice, R207910 exceeded the bactericidal activities of isoniazid and rifampin by at least 1 log unit. Substitution of drugs included in the World Health Organization's first-line tuberculosis treatment regimen (rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide) with R207910 accelerated bactericidal activity, leading to complete culture conversion after 2 months of treatment in some combinations. A single dose of R207910 inhibited mycobacterial growth for 1 week. Plasma levels associated with efficacy in mice were well tolerated in healthy human volunteers. Mutants selected in vitro suggest that the drug targets the proton pump of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase.},

The key scientific advances were not disseminated in the standard fora. The developments outlined in this Perspective are reconstructed from past conversations with some of the inventors of NGS when they were exploring chemistries to sequence even just two bases. Although not privy then to those specific chemistries that finally worked, we suggest the potential problems encountered at each stage. Now that we know the chemistries that work, for the benefit of future generations of scientists, we chart how NGS was developed and thereby illustrate the rationale underlying the enabling chemistry that has impacted biology and indeed society in unprecedented ways.},

Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400–800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from {\textgreater}30× average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications.},

We have characterized the derivatized surfaces for the chemical attachment of oligonucleotides and evaluate the properties relevant for the amplification process: surface density, thermal stability towards thermocycling, functionalization reproducibility and storage stability. The derivatization process, first developed for glass slides, was then adapted to microfabricated glass channels containing integrated fluidic connections. This implementation resulted in an important reduction of reaction times, consumption of reagents and process automation. Innovative analytical methods for the characterization of attached DNA were developed for assessing the surface immobilized DNA content after amplification. The results obtained showed that the BTA chemistry is compatible and suitable for forming highly dense arrays of DNA colonies with optimal surface coverage of about 10 million colonies/cm(2) from the amplification of initial single-template DNA molecules immobilized. We also demonstrate that the dsDNA colonies generated can be quantitatively processed in situ by restriction enzymes digestion. DNA colonies generated using the BTA reagent can be used for further sequence analysis in an unprecedented parallel fashion for low-cost genomic studies.},

We applied our approach to sequence the well-characterized human HG002/NA24385 genome and obtained precision and recall rates of at least 99.91\% for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 95.98\% for insertions and deletions {\textless}50 bp (indels) and 95.99\% for structural variants. Our CCS method matches or exceeds the ability of short-read sequencing to detect small variants and structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the ‘genome in a bottle’ (GIAB) benchmark set. Nearly all (99.64\%) variants can be phased into haplotypes, further improving variant detection. De novo genome assembly using CCS reads alone produced a contiguous and accurate genome with a contig N50 of {\textgreater}15 megabases (Mb) and concordance of 99.997\%, substantially outperforming assembly with less-accurate long reads.},

After a 2-year hiatus following the initial announcement, the first devices have been released as part of an early access program. We explore the performance of this platform by resequencing the lambda phage genome, and amplicons from a snake venom gland transcriptome. Although the handheld MinION sequencer can generate more than 150 megabases of raw data in one run, at most a quarter of the resulting reads map to the reference, with less than average 10\% identity. Much of the sequence consists of insertion/deletion errors, or is seemingly without similarity to the template. Using the lambda phage data as an example, although the reads are long, averaging 5 kb, at best 890 ± 1932 bases per mapped read could be matched to the reference without soft clipping. In the course of a 36 h run on the MinION, it was possible to resequence the 48 kb lambda phage reference at 16× coverage. Currently, substantially larger projects would not be feasible using the MinION. Without increases in accuracy, which would be required for applications such as genome scaffolding and phasing, the current utility of the MinION appears limited. Library preparation requires access to a molecular laboratory, and is of similar complexity and cost to that of other next-generation sequencing platforms. The MinION is an exciting step in a new direction for single-molecule sequencing, though it will require dramatic decreases in error rates before it lives up to its promise.},

	doi = {10.1093/cid/cis255},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: On 22 June 2011, 8 patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or bloody diarrhea were reported in France. All 8 were attendees of a community center event on 8 June near Bordeaux. Three Escherichia coli cases were confirmed by isolation of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O104:H4 stx2 aggR producing a cefotaximase (CTX-M) β-lactamase (STEC O104:H4); the same rare serotype caused the outbreak in Germany in May-July 2011. An investigation was initiated to describe the outbreak, identify the vehicle for infection, and guide control measures.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among all adults attending the event, including food handlers. A standardized questionnaire was administered to participants. A case was an attendee who developed HUS or diarrhea between 8 and 24 June. Cases were confirmed by isolation of STEC O104:H4 or O104 serology. Relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) by exposure were calculated using a Poisson regression model.
RESULTS: Twenty-four cases were identified (14\% attack rate). Of these, 18 (75\%) were women, 22 (92\%) were adults, 7 (29\%) developed HUS, 5 (21\%) developed bloody diarrhea, and 12 (50\%) developed diarrhea. Ten (42\%) cases were confirmed. Fenugreek was the only sprout type with an independent association to illness (RR, 5.1; 95\% CI, 2.3-11.1) in multivariable analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This investigation identified a point-source STEC O104:H4 outbreak associated with consumption of fenugreek sprouts. Comparison of results from French and German STEC O104:H4 outbreak investigations enabled identification of a common food vehicle, fenugreek sprouts, and resulted in implementation of Europe-wide control measures in July 2011.},

Serotype O104:H4, which has not been detected in animals, has rarely been associated with HUS in the past. To prospectively elucidate the unique characteristics of this strain in the early stages of this outbreak, we applied whole genome sequencing on the Life Technologies Ion Torrent PGM™ sequencer and Optical Mapping to characterize one outbreak isolate (LB226692) and a historic O104:H4 HUS isolate from 2001 (01-09591). Reference guided draft assemblies of both strains were completed with the newly introduced PGM™ within 62 hours. The HUS-associated strains both carried genes typically found in two types of pathogenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Phylogenetic analyses of 1,144 core E. coli genes indicate that the HUS-causing O104:H4 strains and the previously published sequence of the EAEC strain 55989 show a close relationship but are only distantly related to common EHEC serotypes. Though closely related, the outbreak strain differs from the 2001 strain in plasmid content and fimbrial genes. We propose a model in which EAEC 55989 and EHEC O104:H4 strains evolved from a common EHEC O104:H4 progenitor, and suggest that by stepwise gain and loss of chromosomal and plasmid-encoded virulence factors, a highly pathogenic hybrid of EAEC and EHEC emerged as the current outbreak clone. In conclusion, rapid next-generation technologies facilitated prospective whole genome characterization in the early stages of an outbreak.},

A multiagency collaboration began performing real-time, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on all US Lm isolates from patients, food, and the environment in September 2013, posting sequencing data into a public repository. Compared with the year before the project began, WGS, combined with epidemiologic and product trace-back data, detected more listeriosis clusters and solved more outbreaks (2 outbreaks in pre-WGS year, 5 in WGS year 1, and 9 in year 2). Whole-genome multilocus sequence typing and single nucleotide polymorphism analyses provided equivalent phylogenetic relationships relevant to investigations; results were most useful when interpreted in context of epidemiological data.

For the past two decades, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was the gold standard subtyping method for the pathogens tracked by PulseNet. A new gold standard is now being implemented with the introduction of cost-effective whole genome sequencing (WGS) for analysis of all the organisms tracked by PulseNet. This transformation is a major undertaking that touches every functional aspect of PulseNet, including laboratory workflows, data storage, analysis management and data interpretation, and language used to communicate information (sequence profile nomenclature system). The benefits of implementing WGS go beyond improved discrimination and precision of the data; it provides an opportunity to determine strain characteristics typically obtained through resource-intensive traditional methodologies, for example, species identification, serotyping, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance profiling, all of which can be consolidated into a single WGS workflow. Such a strategy represents a major shift in the workflows currently practiced in most public health laboratories, but one that brings opportunities for streamlining surveillance activities for the network as a whole. In this study, we provide a brief summary of PulseNet's evolution the past decade along with a general description of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.},

As access to whole-genome sequencing has grown, greater amounts of molecular data have helped improve the ability to detect and track outbreaks of diseases such as COVID-19, investigate transmission chains and explore large-scale population dynamics, such as the spread of antibiotic resistance. However, the wide adoption of whole-genome sequencing also poses new challenges for public-health agencies that must adapt to support a new set of expertise, which means that the capacity to perform genomic data assembly and analysis has not expanded as widely as the adoption of sequencing itself. In this Perspective, we make recommendations for developing an accessible, unified informatic ecosystem to support pathogen genomic analysis in public-health agencies across income settings. We hope that the creation of this ecosystem will allow agencies to effectively and efficiently share data, workflows and analyses and thereby increase the reproducibility, accessibility and auditability of pathogen genomic analysis while also supporting agency autonomy.},

	abstract = {In response to the EFSA call New approaches in identifying and characterizing microbial and chemical hazards, the project INNUENDO (https://sites.google.com/site/theinnuendoproject/) aimed to design an analytical platform and standard procedures for the use of whole-genome sequencing in surveillance and outbreak investigation of food-borne pathogens. The project firstly attempted to identify existing flaws and needs, and then to provide applicable cross-sectorial solutions. The project focused in developing a platform for small countries with limited economical and personnel resources. To achieve these goals, we applied a user-centered design strategy involving the end-users, such as microbiologists in public health and veterinary authorities, in every step of the design, development and implementation phases. As a result, we delivered the INNUENDO Platform V1.0 (https://innuendo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a stand-alone, portable, open-source, end-to-end system for the management, analysis, and sharing of bacterial genomic data. The platform uses Nextflow workflow manager to assemble analytical software modules in species-specific protocols that can be run using a user-friendly interface. The reproducibility of the process is ensured by using Docker containers and throught the annotation of the whole process using an ontology. Several modules, available at https://github.com/TheInnuendoProject, have been developed including: genome assembly and species confirmation; fast genome clustering; in silico typing; standardized species-specific phylogenetic frameworks for Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli based on an innovative gene-by-gene methodology; quality control measures from raw reads to allele calling; reporting system; a built-in communication protocols and a strain classification system enabling smooth communication during outbreak investigation. As proof-of-concepts, the proposed solutions have been thoroughly tested in simulated outbreak conditions by several public health and veterinary agencies across Europe. The results have been widely disseminated through several channels (web-sites, scientific publications, organization of workshops). The INNUENDO Platform V1.0 is effectively one of the models for the usage of open-source software in genomic epidemiology.},

Here, we provide an overview of how EnteroBase works, what it can do, and its future prospects. EnteroBase has currently assembled more than 300,000 genomes from Illumina short reads from Salmonella, Escherichia, Yersinia, Clostridioides, Helicobacter, Vibrio, and Moraxella and genotyped those assemblies by core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). Hierarchical clustering of cgMLST sequence types allows mapping a new bacterial strain to predefined population structures at multiple levels of resolution within a few hours after uploading its short reads. Case Study 1 illustrates this process for local transmissions of Salmonella enterica serovar Agama between neighboring social groups of badgers and humans. EnteroBase also supports single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls from both genomic assemblies and after extraction from metagenomic sequences, as illustrated by Case Study 2 which summarizes the microevolution of Yersinia pestis over the last 5000 years of pandemic plague. EnteroBase can also provide a global overview of the genomic diversity within an entire genus, as illustrated by Case Study 3, which presents a novel, global overview of the population structure of all of the species, subspecies, and clades within Escherichia.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Streptococcus agalactiae [group B streptococci (GBS)] have been considered uniformly susceptible to penicillin. However, increasing reports from Asia and North America are documenting penicillin-non-susceptible GBS (PRGBS) with mutations in pbp genes. Here we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first two PRGBS isolates recovered in Europe (AC-13238-1 and AC-13238-2), isolated from the same patient.
METHODS: Two different colony morphologies of GBS were noted from a surgical abscess drainage sample. Both were serotyped and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by different methodologies. High-throughput sequencing was done to compare the isolates at the genomic level, to identify their capsular type and ST, to evaluate mutations in the pbp genes and to compare the isolates with the genomes of other PRGBS isolates sharing the same serotype and ST.
RESULTS: Isolates AC-13238-1 and AC-13238-2 presented MICs above the EUCAST and CLSI breakpoints for penicillin susceptibility. Both shared the capsular type Ia operon and ST23. Genomic analysis uncovered differences between the two isolates in seven genes, including altered pbp genes. Deduced amino acid sequences revealed critical substitutions in PBP2X in both isolates. Comparison with serotype Ia clonal complex 23 PRGBS from the USA reinforced the similarity between AC-13238-1 and AC-13238-2, and their divergence from the US strains.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the in-host evolution of β-lactam-resistant GBS, with two PRGBS variants being isolated from one patient.},

Patients infected by the pbp1b641C genotype pneumococci show 2.8-fold odds (95\% CI 1.7 to 4.8) of meningitis compared to those infected by non-pbp1b641C pneumococci, after controlling for pneumococcal serotype, antibiotic resistance, and patient age. The pbp1bA641C change results in longer time needed for bacterial killing by antibiotic treatment and shows evidence of being under positive selection. Thus, a pneumococcal mutation conferring increased antibiotic tolerance is associated with meningitis among IPD patients.},

Phylogenetic and molecular analyses revealed that cbpJ had the highest codon rates to total numbers of codons under considerable negative selection among those examined. Our in vitro and in vivo assays indicated that CbpJ functions as a virulence factor in pneumococcal pneumonia by contributing to evasion of neutrophil killing. Deficiency of cbpL under relaxed selective pressure also caused a similar tendency but showed no significant difference in mouse intranasal infection. Thus, molecular evolutionary analysis is a powerful tool that reveals the importance of virulence factors in real-world infection and transmission, since calculations are performed based on bacterial genome diversity following transmission of infection in an uncontrolled population.},

As vaccination is primarily concerned with the interaction of biological molecules with the immune system, the utility of sequence data is not immediately obvious and, indeed, nucleotide sequence data are most effective when used to complement more conventional immunological approaches. Here, the impact of sequencing on the field of vaccinology will be illustrated with reference to the development and implementation of vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis (the meningococcus) over the 30-year period from the late-1980s to the late-2010s. Nucleotide sequence-based studies have been important in the fight against this aggressive pathogen largely because of its high genetic and antigenic diversity, properties that were only fully appreciated because of sequence-based studies. Five aspects will be considered, the use of sequence data to: (i) discover vaccine antigens; (ii) assess the diversity and distribution of vaccine antigens; (iii) determine the evolutionary and population biology of the organism and their implications for immunization; and (iv) develop molecular approaches to investigate pre- and post-vaccine pathogen populations to assess vaccine impact. One of the great advantages of nucleotide sequence data has been its scalability, which has meant that increasingly large data sets have been available, which has proved invaluable in the investigation of an organism as diverse and enigmatic as the meningococcus.},

	shorttitle = {Apollo},
	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa179},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Third-generation sequencing technologies can sequence long reads that contain as many as 2 million base pairs. These long reads are used to construct an assembly (i.e. the subject's genome), which is further used in downstream genome analysis. Unfortunately, third-generation sequencing technologies have high sequencing error rates and a large proportion of base pairs in these long reads is incorrectly identified. These errors propagate to the assembly and affect the accuracy of genome analysis. Assembly polishing algorithms minimize such error propagation by polishing or fixing errors in the assembly by using information from alignments between reads and the assembly (i.e. read-to-assembly alignment information). However, current assembly polishing algorithms can only polish an assembly using reads from either a certain sequencing technology or a small assembly. Such technology-dependency and assembly-size dependency require researchers to (i) run multiple polishing algorithms and (ii) use small chunks of a large genome to use all available readsets and polish large genomes, respectively.
RESULTS: We introduce Apollo, a universal assembly polishing algorithm that scales well to polish an assembly of any size (i.e. both large and small genomes) using reads from all sequencing technologies (i.e. second- and third-generation). Our goal is to provide a single algorithm that uses read sets from all available sequencing technologies to improve the accuracy of assembly polishing and that can polish large genomes. Apollo (i) models an assembly as a profile hidden Markov model (pHMM), (ii) uses read-to-assembly alignment to train the pHMM with the Forward-Backward algorithm and (iii) decodes the trained model with the Viterbi algorithm to produce a polished assembly. Our experiments with real readsets demonstrate that Apollo is the only algorithm that (i) uses reads from any sequencing technology within a single run and (ii) scales well to polish large assemblies without splitting the assembly into multiple parts.

	abstract = {We have employed whole genome sequencing to define and evaluate a core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) scheme for Acinetobacter baumannii. To define a core genome we downloaded a total of 1,573 putative A. baumannii genomes from NCBI as well as representative isolates belonging to the eight previously described international A. baumannii clonal lineages. The core genome was then employed against a total of fifty-three carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates that were previously typed by PFGE and linked to hospital outbreaks in eight German cities. We defined a core genome of 2,390 genes of which an average 98.4\% were called successfully from 1,339 A. baumannii genomes, while Acinetobacter nosocomialis, Acinetobacter pittii, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus resulted in 71.2\%, 33.3\%, and 23.2\% good targets, respectively. When tested against the previously identified outbreak strains, we found good correlation between PFGE and cgMLST clustering, with 0-8 allelic differences within a pulsotype, and 40-2,166 differences between pulsotypes. The highest number of allelic differences was between the isolates representing the international clones. This typing scheme was highly discriminatory and identified separate A. baumannii outbreaks. Moreover, because a standardised cgMLST nomenclature is used, the system will allow inter-laboratory exchange of data.},

A collection of 325 macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes isolates associated with pharyngitis cases in Portugal was used to benchmark the proposed measures. All isolates were characterized by macrolide resistance phenotyping, T serotyping, emm sequence typing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), using SmaI or Cfr9I and SfiI. A subset of 41 isolates, representing each PFGE cluster, was also characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The application of Adjusted Rand and Wallace indices allowed the evaluation of the strength and the directionality of the correspondences between the various typing methods and showed that if PFGE or MLST data are available one can confidently predict the emm type (Wallace coefficients of 0.952 for both methods). In contrast, emm typing was a poor predictor of PFGE cluster or MLST sequence type (Wallace coefficients of 0.803 and 0.655, respectively). This was confirmed by the analysis of the larger data set available from http://spyogenes.mlst.net and underscores the necessity of performing PFGE or MLST to unambiguously define clones in S. pyogenes.},

	abstract = {The profiling of the superantigen (SAg) encoding genes has been frequently used as a complementary typing method for group A streptococci (GAS), but a confusing gene nomenclature and a large diversity of primers used in screening has led to some conflicting results. The aim of this work was to develop a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method capable of efficiently amplifying all the known allelic variants of these genes, and to evaluate the congruence of this methodology with other commonly used molecular typing methods. The presence of the 11 known SAg genes and two other exotoxin-encoding genes (speB and speF) was tested in a collection of 480 clinical GAS isolates, using two multiplex PCR reactions. The SAg gene profile was compared with other typing methods. Four naturally occurring deletions involving the genes speB, speF, and rgg were characterized, two of which were found among invasive isolates. The absence of the chromosomally encoded genes speG and smeZ was supported by Southern blot hybridization and associated with specific GAS lineages, while the presence of phage-encoded genes was more variable. Positive associations between SAg genes or between SAg profiles and emm types or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) clusters were observed. The results suggest that the SAg profile diversifies faster than other properties commonly used for molecular typing, such as emm type and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence types (STs), and can be a useful complement in GAS molecular epidemiology. Still, the short-term stability of the SAg gene profile among prevalent genetic lineages may largely explain the observed associations between SAg genes.},

	abstract = {Group A Streptococcus (GAS) genotype emm89 is increasingly recognized as a leading cause of disease worldwide, yet factors that underlie the success of this emm type are unknown. Surveillance identified a sustained nationwide increase in emm89 invasive GAS disease in the United Kingdom, prompting longitudinal investigation of this genotype. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a recent dramatic shift in the emm89 population with the emergence of a new clade that increased to dominance over previous emm89 variants. Temporal analysis indicated that the clade arose in the early 1990s but abruptly increased in prevalence in 2008, coinciding with an increased incidence of emm89 infections. Although standard variable typing regions (emm subtype, tee type, sof type, and multilocus sequence typing [MLST]) remained unchanged, uniquely the emergent clade had undergone six distinct regions of homologous recombination across the genome compared to the rest of the sequenced emm89 population. Two of these regions affected known virulence factors, the hyaluronic acid capsule and the toxins NADase and streptolysin O. Unexpectedly, and in contrast to the rest of the sequenced emm89 population, the emergent clade-associated strains were genetically acapsular, rendering them unable to produce the hyaluronic acid capsule. The emergent clade-associated strains had also acquired an NADase/streptolysin O locus nearly identical to that found in emm12 and modern emm1 strains but different from the rest of the sequenced emm89 population. The emergent clade-associated strains had enhanced expression of NADase and streptolysin O. The genome remodeling in the new clade variant and the resultant altered phenotype appear to have conferred a selective advantage over other emm89 variants and may explain the changes observed in emm89 GAS epidemiology.
IMPORTANCE: Sudden upsurges or epidemic waves are common features of group A streptococcal disease. Although the mechanisms behind such changes are largely unknown, they are often associated with an expansion of a single genotype within the population. Using whole-genome sequencing, we investigated a nationwide increase in invasive disease caused by the genotype emm89 in the United Kingdom. We identified a new clade variant that had recently emerged in the emm89 population after having undergone several core genomic recombination-related changes, two of which affected known virulence factors. An unusual finding of the new variant was the loss of the hyaluronic acid capsule, previously thought to be essential for causing invasive disease. A further genomic adaptation in the NADase/streptolysin O locus resulted in enhanced production of these toxins. Recombination-related genome remodeling is clearly an important mechanism in group A Streptococcus that can give rise to more successful and potentially more pathogenic variants.},

	abstract = {The identification of the molecular events responsible for strain emergence, enhanced virulence, and epidemicity has been a long-pursued goal in infectious diseases research. A recent analysis of 3,615 genomes of serotype M1 group A Streptococcus strains (the so-called "flesh-eating" bacterium) identified a recombination event that coincides with the global M1 pandemic beginning in the early 1980s. Here, we have shown that the allelic variation that results from this recombination event, which replaces the chromosomal region encoding secreted NADase and streptolysin O, is the key driver of increased toxin production and enhanced infection severity of the M1 pandemic strains. Using isoallelic mutant strains, we found that 3 polymorphisms in this toxin gene region increase resistance to killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, increase bacterial proliferation, and increase virulence in animal models of pharyngitis and necrotizing fasciitis. Genome sequencing of an additional 1,125 streptococcal strains and virulence studies revealed that a highly similar recombinational replacement event underlies an ongoing intercontinental epidemic of serotype M89 group A Streptococcus infections. By identifying the molecular changes that enhance upper respiratory tract fitness, increased resistance to innate immunity, and increased tissue destruction, we describe a mechanism that underpins epidemic streptococcal infections, which have affected many millions of people.},

	abstract = {Strains of emm89 Streptococcus pyogenes have become one of the major causes of invasive infections worldwide in the last 10 years. We recently sequenced the genome of 1,125 emm89 strains and identified three major phylogenetic groups, designated clade 1, clade 2, and the epidemic clade 3. Epidemic clade 3 strains, which now cause the great majority of infections, have two distinct genetic features compared to clade 1 and clade 2 strains. First, all clade 3 organisms have a variant 3 nga promoter region pattern, which is associated with increased production of secreted cytolytic toxins SPN (S. pyogenes NADase) and SLO (streptolysin O). Second, all clade 3 strains lack the hasABC locus mediating hyaluronic acid capsule synthesis, whereas this locus is intact in clade 1 and clade 2 strains. We constructed isogenic mutant strains that produce different levels of SPN and SLO toxins and capsule (none, low, or high). Here we report that emm89 strains with elevated toxin production are significantly more virulent than low-toxin producers. Importantly, we also show that capsule production is dispensable for virulence in strains that already produce high levels of SPN and SLO. Our results provide new understanding about the molecular mechanisms contributing to the rapid emergence and molecular pathogenesis of epidemic clade 3 emm89 S. pyogenes.
IMPORTANCE: S. pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]) causes pharyngitis ("strep throat"), necrotizing fasciitis, and other human infections. Serious infections caused by emm89 S. pyogenes strains have recently increased in frequency in many countries. Based on whole-genome sequence analysis of 1,125 strains recovered from patients on two continents, we discovered that a new emm89 clone, termed clade 3, has two distinct genetic features compared to its predecessors: (i) absence of the genes encoding antiphagocytic hyaluronic acid capsule virulence factor and (ii) increased production of the secreted cytolytic toxins SPN and SLO. emm89 S. pyogenes strains with the clade 3 phenotype (absence of capsule and high expression of SPN and SLO) are highly virulent in mice. These findings provide new understanding of how new virulent clones emerge and cause severe infections worldwide. This newfound knowledge of S. pyogenes virulence can be used to help understand future epidemics and conduct new translational research.},

	abstract = {We sequenced the genomes of 3,615 strains of serotype Emm protein 1 (M1) group A Streptococcus to unravel the nature and timing of molecular events contributing to the emergence, dissemination, and genetic diversification of an unusually virulent clone that now causes epidemic human infections worldwide. We discovered that the contemporary epidemic clone emerged in stepwise fashion from a precursor cell that first contained the phage encoding an extracellular DNase virulence factor (streptococcal DNase D2, SdaD2) and subsequently acquired the phage encoding the SpeA1 variant of the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A superantigen. The SpeA2 toxin variant evolved from SpeA1 by a single-nucleotide change in the M1 progenitor strain before acquisition by horizontal gene transfer of a large chromosomal region encoding secreted toxins NAD(+)-glycohydrolase and streptolysin O. Acquisition of this 36-kb region in the early 1980s into just one cell containing the phage-encoded sdaD2 and speA2 genes was the final major molecular event preceding the emergence and rapid intercontinental spread of the contemporary epidemic clone. Thus, we resolve a decades-old controversy about the type and sequence of genomic alterations that produced this explosive epidemic. Analysis of comprehensive, population-based contemporary invasive strains from seven countries identified strong patterns of temporal population structure. Compared with a preepidemic reference strain, the contemporary clone is significantly more virulent in nonhuman primate models of pharyngitis and necrotizing fasciitis. A key finding is that the molecular evolutionary events transpiring in just one bacterial cell ultimately have produced millions of human infections worldwide.},

	abstract = {Understanding the fine-structure molecular architecture of bacterial epidemics has been a long-sought goal of infectious disease research. We used short-read-length DNA sequencing coupled with mass spectroscopy analysis of SNPs to study the molecular pathogenomics of three successive epidemics of invasive infections involving 344 serotype M3 group A Streptococcus in Ontario, Canada. Sequencing the genome of 95 strains from the three epidemics, coupled with analysis of 280 biallelic SNPs in all 344 strains, revealed an unexpectedly complex population structure composed of a dynamic mixture of distinct clonally related complexes. We discovered that each epidemic is dominated by micro- and macrobursts of multiple emergent clones, some with distinct strain genotype-patient phenotype relationships. On average, strains were differentiated from one another by only 49 SNPs and 11 insertion-deletion events (indels) in the core genome. Ten percent of SNPs are strain specific; that is, each strain has a unique genome sequence. We identified nonrandom temporal-spatial patterns of strain distribution within and between the epidemic peaks. The extensive full-genome data permitted us to identify genes with significantly increased rates of nonsynonymous (amino acid-altering) nucleotide polymorphisms, thereby providing clues about selective forces operative in the host. Comparative expression microarray analysis revealed that closely related strains differentiated by seemingly modest genetic changes can have significantly divergent transcriptomes. We conclude that enhanced understanding of bacterial epidemics requires a deep-sequencing, geographically centric, comparative pathogenomics strategy.},

We performed retrospective genomic surveillance of 93 clinical GAS isolates from individuals in a defined geographic region. Detailed clinical information was obtained for closely related clusters of isolates. Genomic sequence data was contextualised through comparison with international data. We identified 18 different emm genotypes within our bacterial population, and revealed both highly diverse and closely related isolates. This high level of diversity was maintained even in the context of international sequence data. We also identified two emm1 clusters, and one emm3 cluster, of closely-related isolates that differed only by 1 to 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Analysis of clinical information identified no healthcare associated contact between patients, indicating cryptic community transmission.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To analyse genomic sequence data of referred Streptococcus pyogenes isolates and those pertaining to selected elderly/nursing care or maternity clusters from 2010 to 2015 to ascertain genomic differences between epidemiologically related isolates and unrelated isolates from outbreaks of disease.
METHODS: The genomic sequences of 134 S. pyogenes isolates from 21 clusters of infection in elderly care or maternity settings from 2010 to 2015 were analysed using bioinformatics to ascertain genomic phylogeny, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences and statistical outliers from epidemiologically defined outbreaks. Analysis was undertaken within clusters and compared with sporadic isolates from geographically distinct outbreaks of S. pyogenes infection.
RESULTS: Genomic sequence analysis of 21 outbreaks of S. pyogenes infection ranged in size from a single patient (with colonized healthcare worker link) to 18 patient cases of group A streptococcus (GAS) infection in a single setting. Seventeen healthcare workers were identified in 8 of 21 outbreaks with the associated outbreak strain, with multiple staff in 2 of 21 outbreaks. Genomic sequences from epidemiologically linked isolates from patients, staff and healthcare environmental settings were highly conserved, differing by 0-1 SNP in some cases and mirrored geographical data. Four of 21 outbreaks had environmental contamination with the outbreak strain, indistinguishable or of limited SNP difference to the patient isolates. Genomic SNP analysis enabled exclusion of ten isolates from epidemiological outbreaks.
CONCLUSIONS: Genomic discrimination can be applied to assist outbreak investigation. It enabled confirmation or exclusion of GAS cases from epidemiologically defined outbreaks. Colonization of healthcare workers and environmental contamination with the outbreak strain was demonstrated for several outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Identification of genetic polymorphisms causing increased antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens traditionally has proceeded from observed phenotype to defined mutant genotype. The availability of large collections of microbial genome sequences that lack antibiotic susceptibility metadata provides an important resource and opportunity to obtain new information about increased antimicrobial resistance by a reverse genotype-to-phenotype bioinformatic and experimental workflow. We analyzed 26,465 genome sequences of Streptococcus pyogenes, a human pathogen causing 700 million infections annually. The population genomic data identified amino acid changes in penicillin-binding proteins 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2X with signatures of evolution under positive selection as potential candidates for causing decreased susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics. Construction and analysis of isogenic mutant strains containing individual amino acid replacements in penicillin-binding protein 2X (PBP2X) confirmed that the identified residues produced decreased susceptibility to penicillin. We also discovered the first chimeric PBP2X in S. pyogenes and show that strains containing it have significantly decreased β-lactam susceptibility. The novel integrative reverse genotype-to-phenotype strategy presented is broadly applicable to other pathogens and likely will lead to new knowledge about antimicrobial agent resistance, a massive public health problem worldwide.
IMPORTANCE The recent demonstration that naturally occurring amino acid substitutions in Streptococcus pyogenes PBP2X are sufficient to cause severalfold reduced susceptibility to multiple β-lactam antibiotics in vitro raises the concern that these therapeutic agents may become compromised. Substitutions in PBP2X are common first-step mutations that, with the incremental accumulation of additional adaptive mutations within the PBPs, can result in high-level resistance. Because β-lactam susceptibility testing is not routinely performed, the nature and extent of such substitutions within the PBPs of S. pyogenes are poorly characterized. To address this knowledge deficit, polymorphisms in the PBPs were identified among the most comprehensive cohort of S. pyogenes genome sequences investigated to date. The mutational processes and selective forces acting on the PBPs were assessed to identify specific substitutions likely to influence β-lactam susceptibility and to evaluate factors posited to be impediments to resistance emergence.},

The high genetic plasticity of E. faecalis complicates both molecular investigations and phylogenetic analyses. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) enables unraveling of epidemiological linkages and putative transmission events between humans, animals, and food. Core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) aims to combine the discriminatory power of classical multilocus sequence typing (MLST) with the extensive genetic data obtained by WGS. By sequencing a representative collection of 146 E. faecalis strains isolated from hospital outbreaks, food, animals, and colonization of healthy human individuals, we established a novel cgMLST scheme with 1,972 gene targets within the Ridom SeqSphere+ software. To test the E. faecalis cgMLST scheme and assess the typing performance, different collections comprising environmental and bacteremia isolates, as well as all publicly available genome sequences from the NCBI and SRA databases, were analyzed. In more than 98.6\% of the tested genomes, {\textgreater}95\% good cgMLST target genes were detected (mean, 99.2\% target genes). Our genotyping results not only corroborate the known epidemiological background of the isolates but exceed previous typing resolution. In conclusion, we have created a powerful typing scheme, hence providing an international standardized nomenclature that is suitable for surveillance approaches in various sectors, linking public health, veterinary public health, and food safety in a true One Health fashion.},

This report contains a description of multilocus sequence typing based on seven housekeeping loci for 495 isolates representing 158 emm types, yielding 238 unique combinations of sequence type and emm type. A genotypic marker for tissue site preference (emm pattern) revealed that only 17\% of the emm types displayed the marker representing strong preference for infection at the throat and that 39\% of emm types had the marker for skin tropism, whereas 41\% of emm types harbored the marker for no obvious tissue site preference. As a group, the emm types bearing the emm pattern marker indicative of no obvious tissue site preference were far less likely to have two distinct emm types associated with the same sequence type than either of the two subpopulations having markers for strong tissue tropisms (P {\textless} 0.002). In addition, all genetic diversification events clearly ascribed to a recombinational mechanism involved strains of only two of the emm pattern-defined subpopulations, those representing skin specialists and generalists. The findings suggest that the population genetic structure differs for the tissue-defined subpopulations of S. pyogenes.

The field of microbial bioinformatics is thriving and quickly adapting to technological changes, which creates difficulties for nonbioinformaticians in following the complexity and increasingly obscure jargon of this field.
AIMS: This review is directed towards nonbioinformaticians who wish to gain understanding of the overall microbial bioinformatic processes, from raw data obtained from sequencers to final outputs.
SOURCES: The software and analytical strategies reviewed are based on the personal experience of the authors.
CONTENT: The bioinformatic processes of transforming raw reads to actionable information in a clinical and epidemiologic context is explained. We review the advantages and limitations of two major strategies currently applied: read mapping, which is the comparison with a predefined reference genome, and de novo assembly, which is the unguided assembly of the raw data. Finally, we discuss the main analytical methodologies and the most frequently used freely available software and its application in the context of bacterial infectious disease management.
IMPLICATIONS: High-throughput sequencing technologies are overhauling outbreak investigation and epidemiologic surveillance while creating new challenges due to the amount and complexity of data generated. The continuously evolving field of microbial bioinformatics is required for stakeholders to fully harness the power of these new technologies.},

Rapid cluster identification and pathogen profiling, i.e., of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, are crucial for effective infection control.

In this study, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was applied retrospectively to an unusual spike in MRSA cases in two intensive care units (ICUs) over the course of 4 weeks. While the epidemiological investigation concluded that there were two separate clusters, each associated with one ICU, S. aureus protein A gene (spa) typing data suggested that they belonged to single clonal cluster (all cases shared spa type t001). Standardized gene sets were used to extract an allele-based profile for typing and an antibiotic resistance and toxin gene profile. The WGS results produced high-resolution allelic profiles, which were used to discriminate the MRSA clusters, corroborating the epidemiological investigation and identifying previously unsuspected transmission events. The antibiotic resistance profile was in agreement with the original clinical laboratory susceptibility profile, and the toxin profile provided additional, previously unknown information. WGS coupled with allelic profiling provided a high-resolution method that can be implemented as regular screening for effective infection control.},

To differentiate endogenous infections and transmission events, highly discriminatory subtyping is necessary. Today, methods based on whole-genome sequencing data are increasingly used to subtype bacterial pathogens; however, frequently a standardized methodology and typing nomenclature are missing. Here we report a core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) approach developed for C. difficile Initially, we determined the breadth of the C. difficile population based on all available MLST sequence types with Bayesian inference (BAPS). The resulting BAPS partitions were used in combination with C. difficile clade information to select representative isolates that were subsequently used to define cgMLST target genes. Finally, we evaluated the novel cgMLST scheme with genomes from 3,025 isolates. BAPS grouping (n = 6 groups) together with the clade information led to a total of 11 representative isolates that were included for cgMLST definition and resulted in 2,270 cgMLST genes that were present in all isolates. Overall, 2,184 to 2,268 cgMLST targets were detected in the genome sequences of 70 outbreak-associated and reference strains, and on average 99.3\% cgMLST targets (1,116 to 2,270 targets) were present in 2,954 genomes downloaded from the NCBI database, underlining the representativeness of the cgMLST scheme. Moreover, reanalyzing different cluster scenarios with cgMLST were concordant to published single nucleotide variant analyses. In conclusion, the novel cgMLST is representative for the whole C. difficile population, is highly discriminatory in outbreak situations, and provides a unique nomenclature facilitating interlaboratory exchange.},

	abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has been established for bacterial subtyping and is regularly used to study pathogen transmission, to investigate outbreaks, and to perform routine surveillance. Core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) is a bacterial subtyping method that uses WGS data to provide a high-resolution strain characterization. This study aimed at developing a novel cgMLST scheme for Bacillus anthracis, a notorious pathogen that causes anthrax in livestock and humans worldwide. The scheme comprises 3,803 genes that were conserved in 57 B. anthracis genomes spanning the whole phylogeny. The scheme has been evaluated and applied to 584 genomes from 50 countries. On average, 99.5\% of the cgMLST targets were detected. The cgMLST results confirmed the classical canonical single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) grouping of B. anthracis into major clades and subclades. Genetic distances calculated based on cgMLST were comparable to distances from whole-genome-based SNP analysis with similar phylogenetic topology and comparable discriminatory power. Additionally, the application of the cgMLST scheme to anthrax outbreaks from Germany and Italy led to a definition of a cutoff threshold of five allele differences to trace epidemiologically linked strains for cluster typing and transmission analysis. Finally, the association of two clusters of B. anthracis with human cases of injectional anthrax in four European countries was confirmed using cgMLST. In summary, this study presents a novel cgMLST scheme that provides high-resolution strain genotyping for B. anthracis. This scheme can be used in parallel with SNP typing methods to facilitate rapid and harmonized interlaboratory comparisons, essential for global surveillance and outbreak analysis. The scheme is publicly available for application by users, including those with little bioinformatics knowledge.},

	abstract = {The human-restricted bacterium Haemophilus influenzae is responsible for respiratory infections in both children and adults. While colonization begins in the upper airways, it can spread throughout the respiratory tract potentially leading to invasive infections. Although the spread of H. influenzae serotype b (Hib) has been prevented by vaccination, the emergence of infections by other serotypes as well as by non-typeable isolates (NTHi) have been observed, prompting the need for novel prevention strategies. Here, we aimed to study the population structure of H. influenzae and to get some insights into its pan-genome. We studied 305H. influenzae strains, enrolling 217 publicly available genomes, as well as 88 newly sequenced H. influenzae invasive strains isolated in Portugal, spanning a 24-year period. NTHi isolates presented a core-SNP-based genetic diversity about 10-fold higher than the one observed for Hib. The analysis of key factors involved in pathogenesis, such as lipooligosaccharides, hemagglutinating pili and High Molecular Weight-adhesins, suggests that NTHi shape its virulence repertoire, either by acquisition and loss of genes or by SNP-based diversification, likely towards host immune evasion and persistence. Discreet NTHi subpopulations structures are proposed based on core-genome supported with 17 candidate genetic markers identified in the accessory genome. Additionally, this study provides two bioinformatics tools for in silico rapid identification of H. influenzae serotypes and NTHi clades previously proposed, obviating laboratory-based demanding procedures. The present study constitutes an important genomic framework that could lay way for future studies on the genetic determinants underlying invasiveness and disease and population structure of H. influenzae.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2180-12-280},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A few lineages of Group A streptococci (GAS) have been associated with a reemergence of severe invasive streptococcal disease in developed countries. However, the majority of the comparisons between invasive and non-invasive GAS isolates have been performed for collections of reduced genetic diversity or relied on limited typing information to distinguish clones. We characterized by several typing methods and compared a collection of 160 isolates recovered from normally sterile sites with 320 isolates associated with pharyngitis and recovered in the same time period in Portugal.
RESULTS: Although most of the isolates belonged to clones that were equally prevalent in invasive infections and pharyngitis, we identified markers of invasiveness, namely the emm types 1 and 64, and the presence of the speA and speJ genes. In contrast, emm4, emm75, and the ssa and speL/M genes were significantly associated with pharyngitis. There was a strong agreement between the emm type, the superantigen (SAg) genes and the clusters defined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiling. Therefore, combinations of particular emm types and SAg genes frequently co-occurred in the same PFGE cluster, but there was no synergistic or antagonistic interaction between them in determining invasiveness. Only macrolide-susceptible PFGE clones were significantly associated with invasive infections or pharyngitis, while the clones of resistant isolates sharing all other molecular properties analyzed were equally prevalent in the two groups of isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the importance of the widely disseminated emm1-T1-ST28 clone in invasive infections but also identified other clones linked to either invasive infections (emm64-ST164) or pharyngitis (emm4-T4-ST39), which may be more limited in their temporal and geographical spread. Clonal properties like some emm types or SAg genes were associated with disease presentation, highlighting the importance of bacterial genetic factors to the outcome of GAS infections, although other, yet unidentified factors may also play an important role.},

	abstract = {Although skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) are the most common focal infections associated with invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Lancefield Group A streptococci - GAS), there is scarce information on the characteristics of isolates recovered from SSTI in temperate-climate regions. In this study, 320 GAS isolated from SSTI in Portugal were characterized by multiple typing methods and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and SpeB activity. The covRS and ropB genes of isolates with no detectable SpeB activity were sequenced. The antimicrobial susceptibility profile was similar to that of previously characterized isolates from invasive infections (iGAS), presenting a decreasing trend in macrolide resistance. However, the clonal composition of SSTI between 2005 and 2009 was significantly different from that of contemporary iGAS. Overall, iGAS were associated with emm1 and emm3, while SSTI were associated with emm89, the dominant emm type among SSTI (19\%). Within emm89, SSTI were only significantly associated with isolates lacking the hasABC locus, suggesting that the recently emerged emm89 clade 3 may have an increased potential to cause SSTI. Reflecting these associations between emm type and disease presentation, there were also differences in the distribution of emm clusters, sequence types, and superantigen gene profiles between SSTI and iGAS. According to the predicted ability of each emm cluster to interact with host proteins, iGAS were associated with the ability to bind fibrinogen and albumin, whereas SSTI isolates were associated with the ability to bind C4BP, IgA, and IgG. SpeB activity was absent in 79 isolates (25\%), in line with the proportion previously observed among iGAS. Null covS and ropB alleles (predicted to eliminate protein function) were detected in 10 (3\%) and 12 (4\%) isolates, corresponding to an underrepresentation of mutations impairing CovRS function in SSTI relative to iGAS. Overall, these results indicate that the isolates responsible for SSTI are genetically distinct from those recovered from normally sterile sites, supporting a role for mutations impairing CovRS activity specifically in invasive infection and suggesting that this role relies on a differential regulation of other virulence factors besides SpeB.},

We characterized a collection of 191 GAS isolates recovered from normally sterile sites in Portugal during 2006-2009 and compared them to invasive isolates obtained during 2000-2005. Antimicrobial resistance rates did not change significantly between the two periods and were generally low. In 2006-2009, emm1, emm89, emm3, and emm6 represented 60\% of the isolates. The chromosomally encoded superantigen (SAg) genes speG and smeZ were present in the majority ({\textgreater}90\%) of the isolates, while speJ was found in only 45\%. The phage encoded SAgs varied greatly in prevalence (2-53\%). The distribution of emm types, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiling (PFGE) clusters, and SAg profiles changed significantly between the periods, although there were no statistically supported changes in the prevalence of individual types. While the macrolide susceptible clone emm1-T1-ST28 remained dominant (28\%), there was a significant decrease in clonal diversity as indicated by both PFGE profiling and emm typing. This was accompanied by intra-clonal divergence of SAg profiles, which was statistically confirmed for isolates representing emm1, emm28, and emm44. This diversification was associated with the loss and acquisition of SAg genes, carried by phages and of chromosomal origin. These data suggest an ongoing genomic diversification of GAS invasive isolates in Portugal that may contribute to the persistence of clones with improved fitness or virulence.},

However, these data consist of genomes assembled with different tools and levels of quality checking, and of large volumes of completely unprocessed raw sequence data. In both cases, considerable computational effort is required before biological questions can be addressed. Here, we assembled and characterised 661,405 bacterial genomes retrieved from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) in November of 2018 using a uniform standardised approach. Of these, 311,006 did not previously have an assembly. We produced a searchable COmpact Bit-sliced Signature (COBS) index, facilitating the easy interrogation of the entire dataset for a specific sequence (e.g., gene, mutation, or plasmid). Additional MinHash and pp-sketch indices support genome-wide comparisons and estimations of genomic distance. Combined, this resource will allow data to be easily subset and searched, phylogenetic relationships between genomes to be quickly elucidated, and hypotheses rapidly generated and tested. We believe that this combination of uniform processing and variety of search/filter functionalities will make this a resource of very wide utility. In terms of diversity within the data, a breakdown of the 639,981 high-quality genomes emphasised the uneven species composition of the ENA/public databases, with just 20 of the total 2,336 species making up 90\% of the genomes. The overrepresented species tend to be acute/common human pathogens, aligning with research priorities at different levels from individual interests to funding bodies and national and global public health agencies.},

The wealth of genomic data deposited on public databases such as Sequence Read Archive/European Nucleotide Archive provides a powerful resource for evolutionary analysis and epidemiological surveillance. However, many of the analysis tools currently available do not scale well to these large datasets, nor provide the means to fully integrate ancillary data. Here we present PHYLOViZ 2.0, an extension of PHYLOViZ tool, a platform independent Java tool that allows phylogenetic inference and data visualization for large datasets of sequence based typing methods, including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and whole genome/core genome Multilocus Sequence Typing (wg/cgMLST) analysis. PHYLOViZ 2.0 incorporates new data analysis algorithms and new visualization modules, as well as the capability of saving projects for subsequent work or for dissemination of results.

	abstract = {A steady decline in macrolide resistance among Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci [GAS]) in Portugal was reported during 1999 to 2006. This was accompanied by alterations in the prevalence of macrolide resistance phenotypes and in the clonal composition of the population. In order to test whether changes in the macrolide-resistant population reflected the same changing patterns of the overall population, we characterized both macrolide-susceptible and -resistant GAS associated with a diagnosis of tonsillo-pharyngitis recovered in the period from 2000 to 2005 in Portugal. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiling was the best predictor of emm type and the only typing method that could discriminate clones associated with macrolide resistance and susceptibility within each emm type. Six PFGE clusters were significantly associated with macrolide susceptibility: T3-emm3-ST406, T4-emm4-ST39, T1-emm1-ST28, T6-emm6-ST382, B3264-emm89-ST101/ST408, and T2-emm2-ST55. Four PFGE clusters were associated with macrolide resistance: T4-emm4-ST39, T28-emm28-ST52, T12-emm22-ST46, and T1-emm1-ST28. We found no evidence for frequent ongoing horizontal transfer of macrolide resistance determinants. The diversity of the macrolide-resistant population was lower than that of susceptible isolates. The differences found between the two populations suggest that the macrolide-resistant population of GAS has its own dynamics, independent of the behavior of the susceptible population.},

S. pyogenes may exhibit macrolide resistance because of active efflux (mef genes) or target modification (erm genes), the latter conferring cross resistance to lincosamides and streptogramin B. Worldwide, resistance is restricted to a limited number of genetic lineages, despite resistance genes being encoded on mobile genetic elements. For reasons that are not completely clear, resistance and the associated phenotypes are highly variable across countries. Although resistance remains high in several countries, particularly in Asia, an overall decreasing trend of resistance has been noted in recent years, mostly in Europe. This decrease is not always accompanied by declines in macrolide consumption, suggesting significant roles of other factors in determining the dynamics of macrolide-resistant clones. Continued surveillance is needed to obtain further insights into the forces governing macrolide resistance in S. pyogenes.},

	abstract = {The mef(A) gene was originally identified as the resistance determinant responsible for type M resistance to macrolides, a phenotype frequently found in clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. MefA was defined as a secondary transporter of the major facilitator superfamily driven by proton-motive force. However, when characterizing the mef(A)-carrying elements Tn1207.1 and Φ1207.3, another macrolide resistance gene, msr(D), was found adjacent to mef(A). To define the respective contribution of mef(A) and msr(D) to macrolide resistance, three isogenic deletion mutants were constructed by transformation of a S. pneumoniae strain carrying Φ1207.3: (i) Δmef(A)-Δmsr(D); (ii) Δmef(A)-msr(D); and (iii) mef(A)-Δmsr(D). Susceptibility testing of mutants clearly showed that msr(D) is required for macrolide resistance, while deletion of mef(A) produced only a twofold reduction in the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for erythromycin. The contribution of msr(D) to macrolide resistance was also studied in S. pyogenes, which is the original host of Φ1207.3. Two isogenic strains of S. pyogenes were constructed: (i) FR156, carrying Φ1207.3, and (ii) FR155, carrying Φ1207.3/Δmsr(D). FR155 was susceptible to erythromycin, whereas FR156 was resistant, with an MIC value of 8 μg/ml. Complementation experiments showed that reintroduction of the msr(D) gene could restore macrolide resistance in Δmsr(D) mutants. Radiolabeled erythromycin was retained by strains lacking msr(D), while msr(D)-carrying strains showed erythromycin efflux. Deletion of mef(A) did not affect erythromycin efflux. This data suggest that type M resistance to macrolides in streptococci is due to an efflux transport system of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, in which mef(A) encodes the transmembrane channel, and msr(D) the two ATP-binding domains.},

We did a systematic review of the global distribution of GAS emm types. 102 articles and reports were included (38 081 isolates). Epidemiological data from high-income countries were predominant, with sparse data from low-income countries. The epidemiology of GAS disease in Africa and the Pacific region seems to be different from that in other regions, particularly high-income countries. In Africa and the Pacific, there were no dominant emm types, a higher diversity of emm types, and many of the common emm types in other parts of the world were less common (including emm 1, 4, 6, and 12). Our data have implications for the development of GAS vaccines. On the basis of the available data, the current formulation of the experimental multivalent emm vaccine would provide good coverage in high-income countries, particularly USA, Canada, and Europe, but poor coverage in Africa and the Pacific, and only average coverage in Asia and the Middle East.},

GAS infections have historically been diseases of poverty and overcrowding, and remain a significant problem in the developing world and in disadvantaged populations within developed countries. With improved living conditions and access to antibiotics, the rates of GAS diseases in developed societies have gradually declined during the 20th century. However, genetic changes in circulating GAS strains and/or changes in host susceptibility to infection can lead to dramatic increases in the rates of specific diseases. No situations exemplify this more than the global upsurge of invasive GAS disease that originated in the 1980s and the regional increases in scarlet fever in north-east Asia and the UK. In each case, increased disease rates have been associated with the emergence of new GAS strains with increased disease-causing capability. Global surveillance for new GAS strains with increased virulence is important and determining why certain populations suddenly become susceptible to circulating strains remains a research priority. Here, we overview the changing epidemiology of GAS infections and the genetic alterations that accompany the emergence of GAS strains with increased capacity to cause disease.},

	abstract = {Infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are difficult to treat and often life threatening and place a burden on the healthcare system. Minimizing the transmission of MDROs in hospitals is a global priority with genomics proving to be a powerful tool for identifying the transmission of MDROs. To optimize the utility of genomics for prospective infection control surveillance, results must be available in real time, reproducible and simple to communicate to clinicians. Traditional reference-based approaches suffer from several limitations for prospective genomic surveillance. Whilst reference-free or pairwise genome comparisons avoid some of these limitations, they can be computationally intensive and time consuming. Split k-mer analysis (SKA) offers a viable alternative facilitating rapid reference-free pairwise comparisons of genomic data, but the optimum SKA parameters for the detection of transmission have not been determined. Additionally, the accuracy of SKA-based inferences has not been measured, nor whether modified quality control parameters are required. Here, we explore the performance of 60 SKA parameter combinations across 50 simulations to quantify the false negative and positive SNP proportions for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Using the optimum parameter combination, we explore concordance between SKA, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), core genome MLST (cgMLST) and Snippy in a real-world dataset. Lastly, we investigate whether simulated plasmid gain or loss could impact SNP detection with SKA. This work identifies that the use of SKA with sequencing reads, a k-mer length of 19 and a minor allele frequency filter of 0.01 is optimal for MDRO transmission detection. Whilst SNP detection with SKA (when used with sequencing reads) undercalls SNPs compared to Snippy, it is significantly faster, especially with larger datasets. SKA has excellent concordance with MLST and cgMLST and is not impacted by simulated plasmid movement. We propose that the use of SKA for the detection of bacterial pathogen transmission is superior to traditional methodologies, capable of providing results in a much shorter timeframe.},

Through a collaborative effort involving eleven European institutes spanning the food, animal, and human health sectors, we aimed to assess the inter-pipeline clustering congruence across all resolution levels and perform an in-depth comparative analysis of cluster composition at outbreak level for four important foodborne pathogens: Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. We found a general concordance between allele-based pipelines for all species, except for C. jejuni, where the different resolution power of allele-based schemas led to marked discrepancies. Still, we identified non-negligible differences in outbreak detection and demonstrated how a threshold flexibilization favors the detection of similar outbreak signals by different laboratories. These results, together with the observation that different traditional typing groups (e.g., serotypes) exhibit a remarkably different genetic diversity, represent valuable information for future outbreak case-definitions and WGS-based nomenclature design. This study reinforces the need, while demonstrating the feasibility, of conducting continuous pipeline comparability assessments, and opens good perspectives for a smoother international and intersectoral cooperation towards an efficient One Health FWD surveillance.},

However, any reference genome contains only a fraction of the microbial pangenome, the total set of genes observed in a given species. Reference-based approaches are thus blind to the dynamics of the accessory genome, as well as variation within gene order and copy number. With the widespread usage of long-read sequencing, the number of high-quality, complete genome assemblies has increased dramatically. In addition to pangenomic approaches that focus on the variation in the sets of genes present in different genomes, complete assemblies allow investigations of the evolution of genome structure and gene order. This latter problem, however, is computationally demanding with few tools available that shed light on these dynamics. Here, we present PanGraph, a Julia-based library and command line interface for aligning whole genomes into a graph. Each genome is represented as a path along vertices, which in turn encapsulate homologous multiple sequence alignments. The resultant data structure succinctly summarizes population-level nucleotide and structural polymorphisms and can be exported into several common formats for either downstream analysis or immediate visualization.},

With the increasing amount and complexity of data, scalability and reproducibility have become essential not just for experiments, but also for computational analysis.

Workflow managers were developed in response to such challenges. They simplify pipeline development, optimize resource usage, handle software installation and versions, and run on different compute platforms, enabling workflow portability and sharing. In this Perspective, we highlight key features of workflow managers, compare commonly used approaches for bioinformatics workflows, and provide a guide for computational and noncomputational users. We outline community-curated pipeline initiatives that enable novice and experienced users to perform complex, best-practice analyses without having to manually assemble workflows. In sum, we illustrate how workflow managers contribute to making computational analysis in biomedical research shareable, scalable, and reproducible.},

Due to large volumes, the analysis and integration of data generated by such high-throughput technologies have become computationally intensive, and analysis can no longer happen on a typical desktop computer.In this chapter we show how to describe and execute the same analysis using a number of workflow systems and how these follow different approaches to tackle execution and reproducibility issues. We show how any researcher can create a reusable and reproducible bioinformatics pipeline that can be deployed and run anywhere. We show how to create a scalable, reusable, and shareable workflow using four different workflow engines: the Common Workflow Language (CWL), Guix Workflow Language (GWL), Snakemake, and Nextflow. Each of which can be run in parallel.We show how to bundle a number of tools used in evolutionary biology by using Debian, GNU Guix, and Bioconda software distributions, along with the use of container systems, such as Docker, GNU Guix, and Singularity. Together these distributions represent the overall majority of software packages relevant for biology, including PAML, Muscle, MAFFT, MrBayes, and BLAST. By bundling software in lightweight containers, they can be deployed on a desktop, in the cloud, and, increasingly, on compute clusters.By bundling software through these public software distributions, and by creating reproducible and shareable pipelines using these workflow engines, not only do bioinformaticians have to spend less time reinventing the wheel but also do we get closer to the ideal of making science reproducible.

	abstract = {Continuous integration (CI) is a well-established technique in commercial and open-source software projects, although not routinely used in scientific publishing. In the scientific software context, CI can serve two functions to increase reproducibility of scientific results: providing an established platform for testing the reproducibility of these results, and demonstrating to other scientists how the code and data generate the published results. We explore scientific software testing and CI strategies using two articles published in the areas of applied mathematics and computational physics. We discuss lessons learned from reproducing these articles as well as examine and discuss existing tests. We introduce the notion of a "scientific test" as one that produces computational results from a published article. We then consider full result reproduction within a CI environment. If authors find their work too time or resource intensive to easily adapt to a CI context, we recommend the inclusion of results from reduced versions of their work (e.g., run at lower resolution, with shorter time scales, with smaller data sets) alongside their primary results within their article. While these smaller versions may be less interesting scientifically, they can serve to verify that published code and data are working properly. We demonstrate such reduction tests on the two articles studied.},

This hinders the discovery of new genomic information as it results in predictions being biased towards existing knowledge. To date, users have lacked a systematic and replicable approach to identify the strengths and weaknesses of any CDS prediction tool and allow them to choose the right tool for their analysis.We present an evaluation framework (ORForise) based on a comprehensive set of 12 primary and 60 secondary metrics that facilitate the assessment of the performance of CDS prediction tools. This makes it possible to identify which performs better for specific use-cases. We use this to assess 15 ab initio- and model-based tools representing those most widely used (historically and currently) to generate the knowledge in genomic databases. We find that the performance of any tool is dependent on the genome being analysed, and no individual tool ranked as the most accurate across all genomes or metrics analysed. Even the top-ranked tools produced conflicting gene collections, which could not be resolved by aggregation. The ORForise evaluation framework provides users with a replicable, data-led approach to make informed tool choices for novel genome annotations and for refining historical annotations.Code and datasets for reproduction and customisation are available at https://github.com/NickJD/ORForise.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a 'DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

The software tools used to analyze omics data have reshaped the landscape of modern biology and become an essential component of biomedical research. These tools are themselves quite complex and often require the installation of other supporting software, libraries and/or databases. A researcher may also be using multiple different tools that require different versions of the same supporting materials. The increasing dependence of biomedical scientists on these powerful tools creates a need for easier installation and greater usability. Packaging and containerization are different approaches to satisfy this need by delivering omics tools already wrapped in additional software that makes the tools easier to install and use. In this systematic review, we describe and compare the features of prominent packaging and containerization platforms. We outline the challenges, advantages and limitations of each approach and some of the most widely used platforms from the perspectives of users, software developers and system administrators.

	abstract = {Systematic implementation of bioinformatics resources for next generation sequencing (NGS)-based clinical testing is an arduous undertaking. One of the key challenges involves developing an ecosystem of information technology infrastructure for enabling scalable and reproducible bioinformatics services that is resilient and secure for handling genetic and protected health information, often embedded in an existing non–bioinformatics-oriented infrastructure. Container technology provides an ideal and infrastructure-agnostic solution for molecular laboratories developing and using bioinformatics pipelines, whether on-premise or using the cloud. A container is a technology that provides a consistent computational environment and enables reproducibility, scalability, and security when developing NGS bioinformatics analysis pipelines. Containers can increase the bioinformatics team's productivity by automating and simplifying the maintenance of complex bioinformatics resources, as well as facilitate validation, version control, and documentation necessary for clinical laboratory regulatory compliance. Although there is increasing popularity in adopting containers for developing NGS bioinformatics pipelines, there is wide variability and inconsistency in the usage of containers that may result in suboptimal performance and potentially compromise the security and privacy of protected health information. In this article, the authors highlight the current state and provide best or recommended practices for building, using containers in NGS bioinformatics solutions in a clinical setting with focus on scalability, optimization, maintainability, and data security.},

	abstract = {Command-line annotation software tools have continuously gained popularity compared to centralized online services due to the worldwide increase of sequenced bacterial genomes. However, results of existing command-line software pipelines heavily depend on taxon-specific databases or sufficiently well annotated reference genomes. Here, we introduce Bakta, a new command-line software tool for the robust, taxon-independent, thorough and, nonetheless, fast annotation of bacterial genomes. Bakta conducts a comprehensive annotation workflow including the detection of small proteins taking into account replicon metadata. The annotation of coding sequences is accelerated via an alignment-free sequence identification approach that in addition facilitates the precise assignment of public database cross-references. Annotation results are exported in GFF3 and International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)-compliant flat files, as well as comprehensive JSON files, facilitating automated downstream analysis. We compared Bakta to other rapid contemporary command-line annotation software tools in both targeted and taxonomically broad benchmarks including isolates and metagenomic-assembled genomes. We demonstrated that Bakta outperforms other tools in terms of functional annotations, the assignment of functional categories and database cross-references, whilst providing comparable wall-clock runtimes. Bakta is implemented in Python 3 and runs on MacOS and Linux systems. It is freely available under a GPLv3 license at https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta. An accompanying web version is available at https://bakta.computational.bio.},

	abstract = {Biological recording is in essence a very simple concept in which a record is the report of a species at a physical location at a certain time. The collation of these records into a dataset is a powerful approach to addressing large-scale questions about biodiversity change. Records are collected by volunteers at times and places that suit them, leading to a variety of biases: uneven sampling over space and time, uneven sampling effort per visit and uneven detectability. These need to be controlled for in statistical analyses that use biological records. In particular, the data are ‘presence-only’, and lack information on the sampling protocol or intensity. Submitting ‘complete lists’ of all the species seen is one potential solution because the data can be treated as ‘presence–absence’ and detectability of each species can be statistically modelled. The corollary of bias is that records vary in their ‘information content’. The information content is a measure of how much an individual record, or collection of records, contributes to reducing uncertainty in a parameter of interest. The information content of biological records varies, depending on the question to which the data are being applied. We consider a set of hypothetical ‘syndromes’ of recording behaviour, each of which is characterized by different information content. We demonstrate how these concepts can be used to support the growth of a particular type of recording behaviour. Approaches to recording are rapidly changing, especially with the growth of mass participation citizen science. We discuss how these developments present a range of challenges and opportunities for biological recording in the future.},

We compare the distribution of 12,454 KEGG gene orthologs (used as trait proxies) in the MAGs and RefSeq genomes, while controlling for environment type (ocean, soil, lake, bioreactor, human, and other animals). Using statistical modeling, we then determine the conditional probabilities that a species is represented in RefSeq depending on its genetic repertoire. We find that the majority of examined genes are significantly biased for or against in RefSeq. Our systematic estimates of gene prevalences across bacteria and archaea in nature and gene-specific biases in reference genomes constitutes a resource for addressing these issues in the future.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have provided the foundation for modern studies into the composition of microbial communities. The use of these NGS methods allows for the detection and identification of (‘difficult-to-culture’) microorganisms using a culture-independent strategy. In the field of routine clinical diagnostics however, the application of NGS is currently limited to microbial strain typing for epidemiological purposes only, even though the implementation of NGS for microbial community analysis may yield clinically important information. This lack of NGS implementation is due to many different factors, including issues relating to NGS method standardization and result reproducibility. In this review article, the authors provide a general introduction to the most widely used NGS methods currently available (i.e., targeted amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics) and the strengths and weaknesses of each method is discussed. The focus of the publication then shifts toward 16S rRNA gene NGS methods, which are currently the most cost-effective and widely used NGS methods for research purposes, and are therefore more likely to be successfully implemented into routine clinical diagnostics in the short term. In this respect, the experimental pitfalls and biases created at each step of the 16S rRNA gene NGS workflow are explained, as well as their potential solutions. Finally, a novel diagnostic microbiota profiling platform (‘MYcrobiota’) is introduced, which was developed by the authors by taking into consideration the pitfalls, biases, and solutions explained in this article. The development of the MYcrobiota, and future NGS methodologies, will help pave the way toward the successful implementation of NGS methodologies into routine clinical diagnostics.},

Whole-genome similarity metrics such as Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) help address this question by facilitating high resolution taxonomic analysis of thousands of genomes from diverse phylogenetic lineages. To scale to available genomes and beyond, we present FastANI, a new method to estimate ANI using alignment-free approximate sequence mapping. FastANI is accurate for both finished and draft genomes, and is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to alignment-based approaches. We leverage FastANI to compute pairwise ANI values among all prokaryotic genomes available in the NCBI database. Our results reveal clear genetic discontinuity, with 99.8\% of the total 8 billion genome pairs analyzed conforming to {\textgreater}95\% intra-species and {\textless}83\% inter-species ANI values. This discontinuity is manifested with or without the most frequently sequenced species, and is robust to historic additions in the genome databases.},

In the past decade, comparisons of thousands of genomes of isolates and hundreds of metagenomes have shown that prokaryotic diversity may be predominantly organized in such sequence-discrete clusters, albeit organisms of intermediate relatedness between the identified clusters are also frequently found. Accumulating evidence suggests, however, that the latter "intermediate" organisms show enough ecological and/or functional distinctiveness to be considered different species. Notably, the area of discontinuity between clusters often-but not always-appears to be around 85\%-95\% genome-average nucleotide identity, consistently among different taxa. More recent studies have revealed remarkably similar diversity patterns for viruses and microbial eukaryotes as well. This high consistency across taxa implies a specific mechanistic process that underlies the maintenance of the clusters. The underlying mechanism may be a substantial reduction in the efficiency of homologous recombination, which mediates (successful) horizontal gene transfer, around 95\% nucleotide identity. Deviations from the 95\% threshold (e.g., species showing lower intraspecies diversity) may be caused by ecological differentiation that imposes barriers to otherwise frequent gene transfer. While this hypothesis that clusters are driven by ecological differentiation coupled to recombination frequency (i.e., higher recombination within vs. between groups) is appealing, the supporting evidence remains anecdotal. The data needed to rigorously test the hypothesis toward advancing the species concept are also outlined.},

Taxonomists have defined species by means of genetic and expressed characters that ensure the members of the unit are monophyletic, and exhibit a large degree of genomic and phenotypic coherence. The new technologies allowing high-throughput data acquisition are expected to improve future classifications significantly and will lead to database-based taxonomy centered on portable and interactive data.

Robust and harmonized molecular epidemiological approaches and population studies that include routine disease screening are needed to efficiently track the origin and spread of Brucella strains. Core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) is a powerful genotyping system commonly used to delineate pathogen transmission routes for disease surveillance and control. Except for Brucella melitensis, cgMLST schemes for Brucella species are currently not established. Here, we describe a novel cgMLST scheme that covers multiple Brucella species. We first determined the phylogenetic breadth of the genus using 612 Brucella genomes. We selected 1,764 genes that were particularly well conserved and typeable in at least 98\% of these genomes. We tested the new scheme on 600 genomes and found high agreement with the whole-genome-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Next, we applied the scheme to reanalyze the genome of Brucella strains from epidemiologically linked outbreaks. We demonstrated the applicability of the new scheme for high-resolution typing required in outbreak investigations as previously reported with whole-genome SNP methods. We also used the novel scheme to define the global population structure of the genus using 1,322 Brucella genomes. Finally, we demonstrated the possibility of tracing distribution of Brucella strains by performing cluster analysis of cgMLST profiles and found nearly identical cgMLST profiles in different countries. Our results show that sequencing depth of more than 40-fold is optimal for allele calling with this scheme. In summary, this study describes a novel Brucella-wide cgMLST scheme that is applicable in Brucella molecular epidemiology and helps in accurately tracking and thus controlling the sources of infection. The scheme is publicly accessible and should represent a valuable resource for laboratories with limited computational resources and bioinformatics expertise.},

Assessing potential cross-protection from leading S. pyogenes vaccine candidates on SDSE, 12/34 preclinical vaccine antigen genes were shown to be present in {\textgreater}99\% of isolates of both species. Relevant to possible vaccine evasion, six vaccine candidate genes demonstrated evidence of inter-species recombination.

	abstract = {PSI-BLAST is an iterative program to search a database for proteins with distant similarity to a query sequence. We investigated over a dozen modifications to the methods used in PSI-BLAST, with the goal of improving accuracy in finding true positive matches. To evaluate performance we used a set of 103 queries for which the true positives in yeast had been annotated by human experts, and a popular measure of retrieval accuracy (ROC) that can be normalized to take on values between 0 (worst) and 1 (best). The modifications we consider novel improve the ROC score from 0.758 +/- 0.005 to 0.895 +/- 0.003. This does not include the benefits from four modifications we included in the 'baseline' version, even though they were not implemented in PSI-BLAST version 2.0. The improvement in accuracy was confirmed on a small second test set. This test involved analyzing three protein families with curated lists of true positives from the non-redundant protein database. The modification that accounts for the majority of the improvement is the use, for each database sequence, of a position-specific scoring system tuned to that sequence's amino acid composition. The use of composition-based statistics is particularly beneficial for large-scale automated applications of PSI-BLAST.},

The minimizer of a string of w consecutive k-mers is the k-mer with smallest value according to an ordering of all k-mers. Syncmers are defined here as a family of alternative methods which select k-mers by inspecting the position of the smallest-valued substring of length s {\textless} k within the k-mer. For example, a closed syncmer is selected if its smallest s-mer is at the start or end of the k-mer. At least one closed syncmer must be found in every window of length (k − s) k-mers. Unlike a minimizer, a syncmer is identified by its sequence alone, and is therefore synchronized in the following sense: if a given k-mer is selected from one sequence, it will also be selected from any other sequence. Also, minimizers can be deleted by mutations in flanking sequence, which cannot happen with syncmers. Experiments on minimizers with parameters used in the minimap2 read mapper and Kraken taxonomy prediction algorithm respectively show that syncmers can simultaneously achieve both lower density and higher conservation compared to minimizers.},

	abstract = {Motivation Sequencing long reads presents novel challenges to mapping. One such challenge is low sequence similarity between the reads and the reference, due to high sequencing error and mutation rates. This occurs, e.g., in a cancer tumor, or due to differences between strains of viruses or bacteria. A key idea in mapping algorithms is to sketch sequences with their minimizers. Recently, syncmers were introduced as an alternative sketching method that is more robust to mutations and sequencing errors. Results We introduce parameterized syncmer schemes (PSS), a generalization of syncmers, and provide a theoretical analysis for multi-parameter schemes. By combining PSS with downsampling or minimizers we can achieve any desired compression and window guarantee. We implemented the use of PSS in the popular minimap2 and Winnowmap2 mappers. In tests on simulated and real long-read data from a variety of genomes, the PSS-based algorithms, with scheme parameters selected on the basis of our theoretical analysis, reduced unmapped reads by 20-60\% at high compression while usually using less memory. The advantage was more pronounced at low sequence identity. At sequence identity of 75\% and medium compression, PSS-minimap had only 37\% as many unmapped reads, and 8\% fewer of the reads that did map were incorrectly mapped. Even at lower compression and error rates, PSS-based mapping mapped more reads than the original minimizer-based mappers as well as mappers using the original syncmer schemes. We conclude that using PSS can improve mapping of long reads in a wide range of settings.},

	doi = {10.1109/IPDPS.2019.00041},
	abstract = {Innovations in Next-Generation Sequencing are enabling generation of DNA sequence data at ever faster rates and at very low cost. For example, the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer can generate 6 Terabases of data in less than two days, sequencing nearly 20 Billion short DNA fragments called reads at the low cost of \$1000 per human genome. Large sequencing centers typically employ hundreds of such systems. Such highthroughput and low-cost generation of data underscores the need for commensurate acceleration in downstream computational analysis of the sequencing data. A fundamental step in downstream analysis is mapping of the reads to a long reference DNA sequence, such as a reference human genome. Sequence mapping is a compute-intensive step that accounts for more than 30\% of the overall time of the GATK (Genome Analysis ToolKit) best practices workflow. BWA-MEM is one of the most widely used tools for sequence mapping and has tens of thousands of users. In this work, we focus on accelerating BWA-MEM through an efficient architecture aware implementation, while maintaining identical output. The volume of data requires distributed computing and is usually processed on clusters or cloud deployments with multicore processors usually being the platform of choice. Since the application can be easily parallelized across multiple sockets (even across distributed memory systems) by simply distributing the reads equally, we focus on performance improvements on a single socket multicore processor. BWA-MEM run time is dominated by three kernels, collectively responsible for more than 85\% of the overall compute time. We improved the performance of the three kernels by 1) using techniques to improve cache reuse, 2) simplifying the algorithms, 3) replacing many small memory allocations with a few large contiguous ones to improve hardware prefetching of data, 4) software prefetching of data, and 5) utilization of SIMD wherever applicable and massive reorganization of the source code to enable these improvements. As a result, we achieved nearly 2x, 183x, and 8x speedups on the three kernels, respectively, resulting in up to 3.5x and 2.4x speedups on end-to-end compute time over the original BWA-MEM on single thread and single socket of Intel Xeon Skylake processor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest reported speedup over BWA-MEM (running on a single CPU) while using a single CPU or a single CPU-single GPGPU/FPGA combination.},

Here we present the novel metagenome classifier Kaiju, which finds maximum (in-)exact matches on the protein-level using the Burrows–Wheeler transform. We show in a genome exclusion benchmark that Kaiju classifies reads with higher sensitivity and similar precision compared with current k-mer-based classifiers, especially in genera that are underrepresented in reference databases. We also demonstrate that Kaiju classifies up to 10 times more reads in real metagenomes. Kaiju can process millions of reads per minute and can run on a standard PC.

The system uses an indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, optimized specifically for the metagenomic classification problem. Centrifuge requires a relatively small index (4.2 GB for 4078 bacterial and 200 archaeal genomes) and classifies sequences at very high speed, allowing it to process the millions of reads from a typical high-throughput DNA sequencing run within a few minutes. Together, these advances enable timely and accurate analysis of large metagenomics data sets on conventional desktop computers. Because of its space-optimized indexing schemes, Centrifuge also makes it possible to index the entire NCBI nonredundant nucleotide sequence database (a total of 109 billion bases) with an index size of 69 GB, in contrast to k-mer-based indexing schemes, which require far more extensive space.},

However, this required annotating contigs, a computationally costly and potentially biased process.We propose SemiBin2, which uses self-supervised learning to learn feature embeddings from the contigs. In simulated and real datasets, we show that self-supervised learning achieves better results than the semi-supervised learning used in SemiBin1 and that SemiBin2 outperforms other state-of-the-art binners. Compared to SemiBin1, SemiBin2 can reconstruct 8.3–21.5\% more high-quality bins and requires only 25\% of the running time and 11\% of peak memory usage in real short-read sequencing samples. To extend SemiBin2 to long-read data, we also propose ensemble-based DBSCAN clustering algorithm, resulting in 13.1–26.3\% more high-quality genomes than the second best binner for long-read data.SemiBin2 is available as open source software at https://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin/ and the analysis scripts used in the study can be found at https://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin2\_benchmark.},

The output from an alignment-free sequence comparison is a similarity score, the interpretation of which is not straightforward. We propose objective functions to interpret and calibrate outputs from alignment-free searches, noting that different objective functions are necessary for different biological contexts. This leads to advantages: visualising and comparing score distributions, including those from true positives, may be a relatively simple method to gain insight into the performance of different metrics. Using an empirical approach with both DNA and protein sequences, we characterise different similarity score distributions generated under different parameters. In particular, we demonstrate how sequence length can affect the scores. We show that scores of true positive sequence pairs may correlate significantly with their mean length; and even if the correlation is weak, the relative difference in length of the sequence pair may significantly reduce the effectiveness of alignment-free metrics. Importantly, we show how objective functions can be used with test data to accurately estimate the probability of true positives. This can significantly increase the utility of alignment-free approaches. Finally, we have developed a general-purpose software tool called KAST for use in high-throughput workflows on Linux clusters.},

Here, we propose a classification model that exploits the complementary nature of alignment-based and alignment-free similarity measures with the aim to improve the accuracy with which DNA and protein sequences are characterized., Results: Our model classifies sequences using a combined sequence similarity score calculated by adaptively weighting the contribution of different sequence similarity measures. Weights are determined independently for each sequence in the test set and reflect the discriminatory ability of individual similarity measures in the training set. Because the similarity between some sequences is determined more accurately with one type of measure rather than another, our classifier allows different sets of weights to be associated with different sequences. Using five different similarity measures, we show that our model significantly improves the classification accuracy over the current composition- and alignment-based models, when predicting the taxonomic lineage for both short viral sequence fragments and complete viral sequences. We also show that our model can be used effectively for the classification of reads from a real metagenome dataset as well as protein sequences., Availability and implementation: All the datasets and the code used in this study are freely available at https://collaborators.oicr.on.ca/vferretti/borozan\_csss/csss.html., Contact:

	abstract = {Bacterial genomes can contain traces of a complex evolutionary history, including extensive homologous recombination, gene loss, gene duplications, and horizontal gene transfer. To reconstruct the phylogenetic and population history of a set of multiple bacteria, it is necessary to examine their pangenome, the composite of all the genes in the set. Here we introduce PEPPAN, a novel pipeline that can reliably construct pangenomes from thousands of genetically diverse bacterial genomes that represent the diversity of an entire genus. PEPPAN outperforms existing pangenome methods by providing consistent gene and pseudogene annotations extended by similarity-based gene predictions, and identifying and excluding paralogs by combining tree- and synteny-based approaches. The PEPPAN package additionally includes PEPPAN\_parser, which implements additional downstream analyses, including the calculation of trees based on accessory gene content or allelic differences between core genes. To test the accuracy of PEPPAN, we implemented SimPan, a novel pipeline for simulating the evolution of bacterial pangenomes. We compared the accuracy and speed of PEPPAN with four state-of-the-art pangenome pipelines using both empirical and simulated data sets. PEPPAN was more accurate and more specific than any of the other pipelines and was almost as fast as any of them. As a case study, we used PEPPAN to construct a pangenome of approximately 40,000 genes from 3052 representative genomes spanning at least 80 species of Streptococcus. The resulting gene and allelic trees provide an unprecedented overview of the genomic diversity of the entire Streptococcus genus.},

Most strain-comparison methods quantify differences in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and are insensitive to structural changes.

We introduce SynTracker, a tool that compares microbial strains using genome synteny—the order of sequence blocks in homologous genomic regions—in pairs of metagenomic assemblies or genomes. Genome synteny is a rich source of genomic information untapped by current strain-comparison tools. SynTracker has low sensitivity to SNPs, has no database requirement and is robust to sequencing errors. It outperforms existing tools when tracking strains in metagenomic data and is particularly suited for phages, plasmids and other low-data contexts. Applied to single-species datasets and human gut metagenomes, SynTracker, combined with an SNP-based tool, detects strains enriched in either point mutations or structural changes, providing insights into microbial evolution in situ.},

	abstract = {By decomposing genome sequences into k-mers, it is possible to estimate genome differences without alignment. Techniques such as k-mer minimisers, for example MinHash, have been developed and are often accurate approximations of distances based on full k-mer sets. These and other alignment-free methods avoid the large temporal and computational expense of alignment. However, these k-mer set comparisons are not entirely accurate within-species and can be completely inaccurate within-lineage. This is due, in part, to their inability to distinguish core polymorphism from accessory differences. Here we present a new approach, KmerAperture, which uses information on the k-mer relative genomic positions to determine the type of polymorphism causing differences in k-mer presence and absence between pairs of genomes. Single SNPs are expected to result in k unique contiguous k-mers per genome. On the other hand, contiguous series {\textgreater} k may be caused by accessory differences of length S-k+1; when the start and end of the sequence are contiguous with homologous sequence. Alternatively, they may be caused by multiple SNPs within k bp from each other and KmerAperture can determine whether that is the case. To demonstrate use cases KmerAperture was benchmarked using datasets including a very low diversity simulated population with accessory content independent from the number of SNPs, a simulated population where SNPs are spatially dense, a moderately diverse real cluster of genomes (Escherichia coli ST1193) with a large accessory genome and a low diversity real genome cluster (Salmonella Typhimurium ST34). We show that KmerAperture can accurately distinguish both core and accessory sequence diversity without alignment, outperforming other k-mer based tools.},

	abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus represents a serious infectious threat to global public health and a vaccine against S. aureus represents an unmet medical need. We here characterise two S. aureus vaccine candidates, coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CgoX) and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI), which fulfil essential housekeeping functions in heme synthesis and glycolysis, respectively. Immunisation with rCgoX and rTPI elicited protective immunity against S. aureus bacteremia. Two monoclonal antibodies (mAb), CgoX-D3 and TPI-H8, raised against CgoX and TPI, efficiently provided protection against S. aureus infection. MAb-CgoX-D3 recognised a linear epitope spanning 12 amino acids (aa), whereas TPI-H8 recognised a larger discontinuous epitope. The CgoX-D3 epitope conjugated to BSA elicited a strong, protective immune response against S. aureus infection. The CgoX-D3 epitope is highly conserved in clinical S. aureus isolates, indicating its potential wide usability against S. aureus infection. These data suggest that immunofocusing through epitope-based immunisation constitutes a strategy for the development of a S. aureus vaccine with greater efficacy and better safety profile.},

E. ictaluri species has an open pan-genome consisting of 2615 core genes and 5592 pan genes. Phylogenetic analysis using core genome MLST (cgMLST) and ANI values consistently placed E. ictaluri isolates into 4 host-specific genotypes. Presence of unique genes and absence of certain genes from each genotype provided potential biomarkers for further development of genotyping scheme. Vaccine candidates with high antigenic, solubility and secretion probabilities were identified in silico from the core genes. Microevolution within the species is brought about by bacteriophages and insertion elements and possibly drive host adaptation.},

	abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

Here we describe our AlphaFold 3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein–ligand interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy for protein–nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher antibody–antigen prediction accuracy compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.37,8. Together, these results show that high-accuracy modelling across biomolecular space is possible within a single unified deep-learning framework.},

	abstract = {Data sharing is central to the rapid translation of research into advances in clinical medicine and public health practice. In the context of COVID-19, there has been a rush to share data marked by an explosion of population-specific and discipline-specific resources for collecting, curating, and disseminating participant-level data. We conducted a scoping review and cross-sectional survey to identify and describe COVID-19-related platforms and registries that harmonise and share participant-level clinical, omics (eg, genomic and metabolomic data), imaging data, and metadata. We assess how these initiatives map to the best practices for the ethical and equitable management of data and the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) principles for data resources. We review gaps and redundancies in COVID-19 data-sharing efforts and provide recommendations to build on existing synergies that align with frameworks for effective and equitable data reuse. We identified 44 COVID-19-related registries and 20 platforms from the scoping review. Data-sharing resources were concentrated in high-income countries and siloed by comorbidity, body system, and data type. Resources for harmonising and sharing clinical data were less likely to implement FAIR principles than those sharing omics or imaging data. Our findings are that more data sharing does not equate to better data sharing, and the semantic and technical interoperability of platforms and registries harmonising and sharing COVID-19-related participant-level data needs to improve to facilitate the global collaboration required to address the COVID-19 crisis.},

In the face of the current pandemic, PHA4GE has identified a need for a fit-for-purpose, open-source SARS-CoV-2 contextual data standard.As such, we have developed a SARS-CoV-2 contextual data specification package based on harmonizable, publicly available community standards. The specification can be implemented via a collection template, as well as an array of protocols and tools to support both the harmonization and submission of sequence data and contextual information to public biorepositories.Well-structured, rich contextual data add value, promote reuse, and enable aggregation and integration of disparate datasets. Adoption of the proposed standard and practices will better enable interoperability between datasets and systems, improve the consistency and utility of generated data, and ultimately facilitate novel insights and discoveries in SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
